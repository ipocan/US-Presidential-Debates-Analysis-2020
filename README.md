# US-Presidential-Debates-Analysis-2020

I this project I would like to analyse US 2020 presidential debate by focusing on speech types of the two politicians, Donald Trump and Joe Biden. It is interesting to figure out and understand the character and personality of each politician by analysing their speech types. I would like to analyse the sentiment scores of speakers during the debates. I will figure out the **polarity** "how positive or negative a word" and **subjectivity** "how subjective or opinionated a word" is. The key aspect of sentiment analysis is to analyze a body of text for understanding the opinion expressed by it.
## Context
