Each document in the text can include one or multiple topics. I will apply the steps of **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** that is a technique used for topic modeling. To implement topic modeling technique, we need to use a document-term matrix and the number of topics. \n","When the topic modeling technique is applied, we will interpret the results and see if the words in each topic make sense.\n","\n","The steps in the notebook are:\n","1.
