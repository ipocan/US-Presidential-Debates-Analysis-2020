I will tell you very simply. We won the election. Elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all. Top, top academic, good in every way. Good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think she’s going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself. I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding. She’s going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that. We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, said she’s the single greatest student he’s ever had. He’s been a professor for a long time at a great school., And we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise. And by the way, the Democrats, they wouldn’t even think about not doing it. The only difference is they’d try and do it faster. There’s no way they would give it up. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn’t have the election so they were stopped. And probably that would happen in reverse, also. Definitely would happen in reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris., Thank you, Joe., There aren’t a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions. As far as a say is concerned, the people already had their say. Okay, Justice Ginsburg said very powerfully, very strongly, at some point 10 years ago or so, she said a President and the Senate is elected for a period of time, but a President is elected for four years. We’re not elected for three years. I’m not elected for three years. So we have the Senate, we have a President-, During that period of time, during that period of time, we have an opening. I’m not elected for three years. I’m elected for four years. Joe, the hundred million people is totally wrong. I don’t know where you got that number. The bigger problem that you have is that you’re going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care, that they’re very happy this., Well, you’re certainly going to socialist. You’re going to socialist-, That’s not what you’ve said and it’s not what your party is saying., Your party doesn’t say it. Your party wants to go socialist medicine and socialist healthcare., And they’re going to dominate you, Joe. You know that., Not according to Harris., Joe, you’ve had 308,000 military people dying because you couldn’t provide them proper healthcare in the military. So don’t tell me about this., And if you were here, it wouldn’t be 200, it would be two million people because you were very late on the draw. You didn’t want me to ban China, which was heavily infected. You didn’t want me to ban Europe., You would have been much later, Joe, much later., We’re talking about two million people., You don’t know what’s on the ballot. Why is it on the ballot? Why is it on the ballot? It’s not on the ballot., I don’t think so., There’s nothing happening there., You don’t know her view on Roe V. Wade? You don’t know here view., That’s right., Because they want to give good healthcare., Yes, I have. Of course, I have. The individual mandate., Excuse me. I got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big chunk of Obamacare., That is absolutely a big thing. That was the worst part of Obamacare., Chris, that was the worst part of Obamacare., Well, I’ll ask Joe. The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare., I got rid of it. And we will protect people., Go ahead., Well, first of all, I guess I’m debating you, not him, but that’s okay. I’m not surprised. Let me just tell you something. There’s nothing symbolic. I’m cutting drug prices. I’m going with Favored Nations, which no President has the courage to do because you’re going against big pharma. Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%. You could have done it during your 47 year period in government, but you didn’t do it. Nobody’s done it. So we’re cutting healthcare., All of the things that we’ve done., I’ll give you an example. Insulin, it was destroying families, destroying people, the cost. I’m getting it for so cheap it’s like water, you want to know the truth. So cheap. Take a look at all of the drugs that what we’re doing. Prescription drug prices, we’re going to allow our Governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they paid just a tiny fraction of what we do., This is big stuff., That’s not what your party says, by the way., Joe, you agreed with Bernie Sanders, who’s far left, on the manifesto, we call it. And that gives you socialized medicine., Are you saying you didn’t agree?, Not by much., Not by much., If Pocahontas would have left two days early you would have lost every primary., On Super Tuesday, you got very lucky., With what?, With what?, But you agree. Joe, you’re the liar. You graduated last in your class not first in your class., You’d be surprised. You’d be surprised. Go ahead, Joe., Listen, you agreed with Bernie Sanders and the manifesto., He just lost the left., You just lost the left. You agreed with Bernie Sanders on a plan that you absolutely agreed to and under that plan [crosstalk 00:15:10], they call it socialized medicine., Who is, Bernie?, No, I want to give them better healthcare at a much lower price, because Obamacare is no good., I’ve already fixed it., We’ve already fixed it to an extent. Obamacare, as you might know but probably don’t, Obamacare is no good., Obamacare is no good. We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on. We took away the individual mandate. We guaranteed pre-existing conditions, but took away the individual mandate. Listen, this is the way it is. And that destroyed … They shouldn’t even call it Obamacare, then I had a choice to make, do I let my people run it really well or badly? If I run it badly, they’ll probably blame him, but they’ll blame me. But more importantly, I want to help people. Okay. I said, “You’ve got to run it so well.” And I just had a meeting with them. They said the problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, it’s a disaster. It’s too expensive. Premiums are too high, that it doesn’t work. So we do want to get rid of it. Chris, we want to get rid of that and give something that’s cheaper and better., Go ahead., Good., Of course, we do., Are you going to pack the court?, Are you going to pack the court?, He doesn’t want to answer the question., Why wouldn’t you answer that question? You want to put a lot of new Supreme Court Justices. Radical left., Listen, who is on your list, Joe? Who’s on your list?, He’s going to pack the court. He is not going to give a list., The people understand, Joe., 47 years, you’ve done nothing. They’re understand., Wrong., Wrong., It’s so wrong., So, if we would have listened to you., If we would’ve listened to you, the country would have been left wide open, millions of people would have died, not 200,000. And one person is too much. It’s China’s fault. It should have never happened. They stopped it from going in, but it was China’s fault. And, by the way, when you talk about numbers, you don’t know how many people died in China. You don’t know how many people died in Russia. You don’t know how many people died in India. They don’t exactly give you a straight count, just so you understand. But if you look at what we’ve done, I closed it and you said, “He’s xenophobic. He’s a racist and he’s xenophobic,” because you didn’t think I should have closed our country. Wait a minute., You didn’t think we should have closed our country because you thought it was terrible. You wouldn’t have closed it for another two months. By my doing it early, in fact, Dr. Fauci said, “President Trump saved thousands of lives.” Many of your Democrat Governors said, “President Trump did a phenomenal job.” We worked with the Governor. Oh really, go take a look. The Governors said I did a phenomenal job. Most of them said that. In fact, people that would not be necessarily on my side said that, “President Trump did a phenomenal job.” We did. We got the gowns. We got the masks. We made the ventilators. You wouldn’t have made ventilators. And now we’re weeks away from a vaccine. We’re doing therapeutics already. Fewer people are dying when they get sick. Far fewer people are dying. We’ve done a great job., The only thing I haven’t done a good job, and that’s because of the fake news, no matter what you say to them, they give you a bad press on it. It’s just fake news. They give you good press, they give me bad press because that’s the way it is, unfortunately. But let me just say something. I don’t care. I’ve gotten used to it. But I’ll tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did. You don’t have it in your blood. You could’ve never done that, Joe., Well, you didn’t do very well in Swine Flu. H1-N1, you were a disaster. Your own Chief of Staff said you were a disaster., A far less lethal disease, by the way., We would have lost far more people, far more people. You would have been months late. You’re months behind me, Joe., You don’t trust Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer?, Well, I’ve spoken to the companies and we can have it a lot sooner. It’s a very political thing because people like this would rather make it political than save lives., It is a very political thing. I’ve spoken to Pfizer, I’ve spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and others. They can go faster than that by a lot. It’s become very political because the left… Or I don’t know if I call them left, I don’t know what I call them., I disagree with him. No, I disagree with both of them. And he didn’t say that. He said it could be there, but it could also be much sooner. I had him in my office two days ago., Because he said it’s a possibility that we’ll have the answer before November 1st. It could also be after that., Well, we’re going to deliver it right away. We have the military all set up. Logistically, they’re all set up. We have our military that delivers soldiers and they can do 200,000 a day. They’re going to be delivering-, It’s all set up., That was said sarcastically, and you know that. That was said sarcastically., You’ll have the vaccine sooner than that., We spoke to the scientists that are in charge-, … they will have the vaccine very soon., Did you use the word smart? So you said you went to Delaware State, but you forgot the name of your college. You didn’t go to Delaware State. You graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. Don’t ever use the word smart with me. Don’t ever use that word., Because you know what? There’s nothing smart about you, Joe. 47 years you’ve done nothing., Let me just tell you something, Joe. If you would have had the charge of what I was put through, I had to close the greatest economy of the history of our country. And by the way, now it’s being built again and it’s going up fast., Okay. It’s going up fast. I look forward to talking about it., Tell that to Nancy Pelosi., Tell that to Nancy Pelosi, and Schumer [crosstalk 00:04:52] Chuck., You probably play more than I do, Joe., Well, he wants to shut down this country and I want to keep it open, and we did a great thing by shutting it down-, Wait a minute, Joe. Let me shut you down for a second, Joe, just for one second. He wants to shut down the country. We just went through it. We had to, because we didn’t know anything about the disease. Now we’ve found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very, very vulnerable. We learned a lot. Young children aren’t, even younger people aren’t. We’ve learned a lot, but he wants to shut it down. More people will be hurt by continuing. If you look at Pennsylvania, if you look at certain states that have been shut down, they have Democrat governors, all, one of the reasons they shut down is because they want to keep it shut down until after the election on November 3rd., Because it’s a political thing., But those states-, Those states are not doing well that are shut down right now., He wants to shut down the whole country., No, I think masks are okay. You have to understand, if you look… I mean, I have a mask right here. I put a mask on when I think I need it. Tonight, as an example, everybody’s had a test and you’ve had social distancing and all of the things that you have to, but I wear masks-, … when needed. When needed, I wear masks., I don’t wear a mask like him. Every time you see him, he’s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from him and he shows up with the biggest mask I’ve ever seen. I will say this-, And they’ve also said the opposite. They’ve also said-, Dr. Fauci. Dr. Fauci said the opposite., He said very strongly, “Masks are not good.” Then he changed his mind. He said, “Masks are good.”, I’m okay with masks. I’m not fighting masks., Outside., Because nobody will show up., Well, it’s true. Nobody shows up to his rallies., Because people want to hear what I have to say. I mean-, … I’m doing my job as a president, and I’ll have 25, 35,000 people show up at airports. We use airports and hangers and we have a lot of people-, Well, so far we have had no problem whatsoever. It’s outside. That’s a big difference according to the experts. We do them outside, we have tremendous crowds, as you see, and literally on 24 hours notice. And Joe does the circles and has three people someplace., We’ve had no negative effect., We’ve had no negative effect, and we’ve had 35, 40,000 people at these rallies., If you could get the crowds, you would have done the same thing. But you can’t. Nobody cares., No cares., Yes., Much faster., So we built the greatest economy in history. We closed it down because of the China plague. When the plague came in, we closed it down, which was very hard psychologically to do. He didn’t think we should close it down and he was wrong. Again, two million people would be dead now instead of… Still, 204,000 people is too much. One person is too much. Should have never happened from China. But what happened is we closed it down and now we’re reopening and we’re doing record business. We had 10.4 million people in a four month period that we’ve put back into the workforce. That’s a record the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before. And he wants to close down the… He will shut it down again. He will destroy this country., A lot of people, between drugs and alcohol and depression, when you start shutting it down, you take a look at what’s happening at some of your Democrat-run states where they have these tough shutdowns. And I’m telling you it’s because they don’t want to open it. One of them came out last week, you saw that, “Oh, we’re going to open up on November 9th.” Why November 9th? Because it’s after the election. They think they’re hurting us by keeping them closed. They’re hurting people. People know what to do. They can social distance. They can wash their hands, they can wear masks. They can do whatever they want, but they got to open these states up., When you look at North Carolina, when you look, and these governors are under siege, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and a couple of others, you got to open these states up. It’s not fair. You’re talking about almost it’s like being in prison. And you look at what’s going on with divorce, look at what’s going on with alcoholism and drugs. It’s a very, very sad thing. And he’ll close down the whole country. This guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country. Our country is coming back incredibly well, setting records as it does it. We don’t need somebody to come in and say, “Let’s shut it down.”, That’s wrong., [crosstalk 00:12:19]., I have to respond to that., Excuse me, he made a statement., No, people want their schools open. They don’t want to be shut down. They don’t want their state shut down. They want their restaurants. I look at New York. It’s so sad what’s happening in New York. It’s almost like a ghost town, and I’m not sure it can ever recover what they’ve done to New York. People want their places open. They want to get back to their lives., They’ll be careful, but they want their schools open., I’m the one that brought back football. By the way, I brought back Big Ten football. It was me and I’m very happy to do it-, … and people of Ohio are very proud of me. And you know how I found out? When [crosstalk 00:14:35]., I paid millions of dollars in taxes, millions of dollars of income tax. And let me just tell you, there was a story in one of the papers that paid-, I paid $38 million one year, I paid $27 million one year., You’ll see it as soon as it’s finished, you’ll see it. You know, if you wanted to, go to the Board of Elections. There’s 118 page or so report that says everything I have, every bank I have, I’m totally under leveraged because the assets are extremely good, and I built a great company., But let me tell you-, Let me-, Millions of dollars., Millions of dollars, yes., Millions of dollars. And you’ll get to see it. And you’ll get to see it., But let me just tell you-, Chris, let me just say something, that it was the tax laws. I don’t want to pay tax. Before I came here, I was a private developer, I was a private business people. Like every other private person, unless they’re stupid, they go through the laws, and that’s what it is. He passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation and for tax credits. We build the building and we get tax credits, like the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. Which by the way, was given to me by the Obama administration, if you can believe that. Now the man got fired right after that happened, but that’s-, That’s okay., But why didn’t you do it over the last 25 years?, Why didn’t you do it over the last 25 years?, You were a Senator and [crosstalk 00:17:21]-, Hey, Joe, let me just tell you, Joe. In 47 months, I’ve done more than you’ve done in 47 years, Joe. We’ve done things that you never even thought of doing., Including fixing the broken military that you gave me, including taking care of your debts., He has none., Why didn’t you do it before, when you were vice president with Obama?, I got it done. And you know what happened?, Our economy boomed like it’s never boomed before., Excuse me., They had the slowest economic recovery since 1929. It was the slowest recovery. Also, they took over something that was down here. All you had to do is turn on the lights and you pick up a lot. But they had the slowest economic recovery since 1929, and let me tell you about the stock market. When the stock market goes up, that means jobs. It also means 401ks. If you got in, if you ever became president with your ideas, you want to terminate my taxes. I’ll tell you what, you’ll lose. Half of the companies that have poured in here will leave. And plenty of companies that are already here, they’ll leave for other places. [crosstalk 00:20:25] They will leave and you will have a depression, the likes of which you’ve never seen., It wasn’t blooming., He was in booming. It was the weakest recovery since 1929., When COVID came along., Excuse me, Chris, wait., Chris., They said it would take… No, you’re on number two., Chris, Chris. They said it would take-, … a miracle to bring back manufacturing. I brought back 700,000 jobs. They brought back nothing. They gave up on manufacturing., … standard fare., He totally gave up on manufacturing., Ohio had the best year it’s ever had last year. Michigan had the best year they’ve ever had., Many car companies came in from Germany, from Japan, went to Michigan, went to Ohio and they didn’t come in with you. [crosstalk 00:21:47]., China ate your lunch- [crosstalk 00:00:22:07]., China ate your lunch, Joe. And no wonder your son goes in and he takes out billions of dollars. He takes out billions of dollars to manage. He makes millions of dollars. And also, while we’re at it, why is it just out of curiosity, the mayor of Moscow’s wife gave you a son three and a half million dollars?, What did he do to deserve it? What did he do with-, … to deserve $183,000?, Oh really, he didn’t get three and a half million?, Well wait, he didn’t get three and a half million dollars, Joe?, He got three and a half million-, … dollars., Oh, really?, It’s a fact., Did Burisma pay him 183,000 a month, with no experience in energy?, I think he did., By who?, The media., By the media, because they refuse to talk about it-, … because they’re embarrassed., So let me ask you this, Joe- [crosstalk 00:23:35]., He got three and a half million dollars from Moscow., Oh, really?, I’d like to know who they are., I’ll fire them., Some people don’t do a good job., Hey, let me just tell you, Joe-, Three and a half million, Joe., Why did he deserve three and a half million from Moscow?, My family-, My family lost a fortune by coming down and helping us with governance., Every single one of them lost a fortune-, Chris, can I be honest? It’s a very important question-, He stood up-, … and the threatened Ukraine-, … with a billion dollars-, Well, and him too., Well, that’s all right, but he does plenty., He does plenty., Oh yeah, sure., That’s true., So-, You did a crime bill, 1994, where you call them super predators. African-Americans are super predators and they’ve never forgotten it. They’ve never forgotten it., So you did that and they call you a super predator and I’m letting people out of jail now, that you have treated the African-American population community, you have treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country. You did the 1990… And that’s why, if you look at the polls, I’m doing better than any Republican has done in a long time, because they saw what you did. You call them super predators, and you’ve called them worse than that. Because you look back at your testimony over the years, you’ve called them a lot worse than that. As far as the church is concerned and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 250 military leaders and generals, total support. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. I have Florida. I have Texas. I have Ohio. I have every… Excuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said, “I support President Trump.”, I don’t think you have any law enforcement. You can’t even say the word law enforcement. Because if you say those words, you’re going to lose all of your radical left supporters. And why aren’t you saying those words, Joe? Why don’t you say the words law enforcement? Because you know what? If called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in a half an hour. But they won’t do it, because they’re run by radical left Democrats. If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle. Minneapolis, we got it back, Joe, because we believe in law and order, but you don’t. The top 10 cities and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats, and in many cases radical left. And they’ve got you wrapped around their finger, Joe, to a point where you don’t want to say anything about law and order. And I’ll tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you’re afraid to even say it., What is peaceful protest? When they run through the middle of the town-, … and burn down your stores and kill people all over the place- [crosstalk 00:32:14]., No it’s not, but you say it is., Fine., I ended it because it’s racist. I ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane. That it a radical revolution that was taking place in our military, in our schools, all over the place. And you know it, and so does everybody else. And he would know it- [crosstalk 00:33:02], If you were a certain person, you had no status in life. It was sort of a reversal. And if you look at the people, we were paying people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly, very sick ideas. And really, they were teaching people to hate our country And I’m not going to do that. I’m not going to allow that to happen. We have to go back to the core values of this country. They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place. It’s a racist place. And they were teaching people to hate our country. And I’m not going to allow that to happen., You just don’t know., During the Obama-Biden administration, there was tremendous division. There was hatred. You look at Ferguson, you look at, or you go to very… Many places, look at Oakland. Look what happened in Oakland. Look what happened in Baltimore. Look what happened… Frankly, it was more violent than what I’m even seeing now., But the reason-, … is that the Democrats that run these cities-, … don’t want to talk, like you, about law and order., And you still haven’t mentioned. Are you in favor of law and order?, Are you in favor of law and order? [crosstalk 00:35:17], Okay., It went down much more in ours., The places we had trouble were democratic run cities-, I think as a party issue, you can bring in a couple of examples but if you look at Chicago, what’s going on in Chicago where a 53 people were shot and eight died shot, if you look at New York where it’s going up, like nobody’s ever seen anything. The numbers are going up a 100%, 150%, 200% crime, it is crazy what’s going on and he doesn’t want to say law and order because he can’t because he’ll lose his radical left supporters and once he does that, it’s over with. But if he ever got to run this country and they ran it the way he would want to run it, we would have by the way our suburbs would be gone. And you would see problems like you’ve never seen before., Oh, I know suburbs so much that you., That’s not what they are talking about this. That’s not what it is about. He’s talking about defunding the police., He doesn’t have any law support. He has no law enforcement., He has almost nothing. Oh, really, who do you have name one group that supports you name one group that came out and supported you. Go ahead. Think we have time., No, no think right now. Name one law enforcement group that came out in support of you., There aren’t any., He’s never done that., Oh really? I sent in the US Marshalls to get the killer of a young man in the middle of the street and they shot him for three days Portland didn’t do anything. I sent in the US Marshals they took care of business., I don’t know who said that., Who?, I don’t think she said that., I don’t think so., Does it mean I have to answer his stuff., Wait a second, you have made a statement., I would love to end it., I’ll send in the National Guard, it would be over. That’d be no problem. But I don’t want to accept the National Guard., Sure, I’m will to do that., I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing not from the right wing., I’m willing to do anything. I want to see peace., What do you want to call them? Give me a name, give me a name, go ahead who do you want me to condemn., Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I’ll tell you what somebody’s got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right wing problem this is a left wing., Oh you got to be kidding me., Well, then you know what, he’s wrong., Antifa is bad., You know what, Antifa is a dangerous radical group., And you ought to be careful of them, they’ll over throw you., Because there is never been an administration or president who has done more than I’ve done in a period of three and a half years. And that’s despite the impeachment hoax and you so what happened today with Hillary Clinton, where it was a whole big con job. But despite going through all of these things where I had a fight, both flanks and behind me and above there has never been an administration that’s done what I’ve done. The greatest, before COVID came in the greatest economy in history, lowest unemployment numbers, everything was good. Everything was going., And by the way, there was unity going to happen. People were calling me for the first time in years, they were calling and they were saying it’s time maybe and then what happened? We got hit. But now we’re building it back up again. A rebuilding of the military, including Space Force and all of the other things. A fixing of the VA which was a mess under him, 308,000 people died because they didn’t have proper health care. It was a mess. And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA, our vets. We take care of our vets. But we’ve rebuilt our military. And I’ll tell you something, some people say maybe the most important by the end of the first term I’ll have approximately 300 Federal judges and Court of Appeals judges, 300 and hopefully three great Supreme Court judges, justices that is a record the likes of which very few people and one of the reasons I’ll have so many judges because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill., When you leave office, you don’t leave any judges. That’s like, you just don’t do that. They left 128 openings and if I were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, I’d say, if you left us 128 openings you can’t be a good president. You can’t be a good vice president but I want to thank you because it gives us almost, it’ll probably be above that number. By the end of this term, 300 judges. It’s a record., You son got three and a half million dollars., Really?, Are you talking Hunter, are you talking about Hunter., I don’t know Beau. I know Hunter. Hunter got thrown out of the military. He was thrown out dishonorably discharged., For cocaine use. And he didn’t have a job until you became vice president., Once you became vice president he made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places., He made a fortune and he didn’t have a job., But why was he given tens of millions of dollars?, I know but when somebody gets three and a half million dollars from the Mayor of Moscow., Why did he get it?, I want crystal clean water and air. I want beautiful clean air. We have now the lowest carbon… If you look at our numbers right now, we are doing phenomenally. But I haven’t destroyed our businesses. Our businesses aren’t put out of commission. If you look at the Paris Accord, it was a disaster from our standpoint. And people are actually very happy about what’s going on because our businesses are doing well. As far as the fires are concerned, you need forest management. In addition to everything else, the forest floors are loaded up with trees, dead trees that are years old and they’re like tinder and leaves and everything else. You drop a cigarette in there the whole forest burns down. You’ve got to have forest management., I believe that we have to do everything we can to have immaculate air immaculate water and do whatever else we can that’s good. We’re planting a billion trees, the Billion Tree Project and it’s very exciting for a lot of people., I think a lot of things do, but I think to an extent, yes. I think to an extent, yes, but I also think we have to do better management of our forest. Every year I get the call. California’s burning, California’s burning. If that was cleaned, if that were, if you had forest management, good forest management, you wouldn’t be getting those calls. In Europe, they live they’re forest cities. They call forest cities. They maintain their forest. They manage their forest. I was with the head of a major country, it’s a forest city. He said, “Sir, we have trees that are far more, they ignite much easier than California. There shouldn’t be that problem.” I spoke with the Governor about it. I’m getting along very well with the governor. But I said, “At some point you can’t every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burned to the ground.” That’s burning down because of a lack of management., Because it was driving energy prices through the sky., Well, not really because what’s happening is the car is much less expensive and it’s a much safer car and you talk it about a tiny difference. And then what would happen because of the cost of the car you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased. We have the old slugs out there that are 10, 12 years old. If you did that, the car would be safer. It would be much cheaper by $3,500., No, but you would take a lot of cars off the market because people would be able to afford a car. Now, by the way, we’re going to see how that turns out. But a lot of people agree with me, many people. The car has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit of gasoline. And I’m okay with electric cars too. I think I’m all for electric cars. I’ve given big incentives for electric cars but what they’ve done in California is just crazy., Not true. Not true-, He’s talking about the Green New Deal. And it’s not 2 billion [crosstalk 00:55:45] or 20 billion, as you said [crosstalk 00:55:46]. It’s $100 trillion., And rebuild the building., It’s the dumbest-, … most ridiculous [crosstalk 00:55:56] where two car systems are out-, … where they want to take out the cows too., That’s not true either, right?, This is a 100 trillion-, That’s more money than our country could make in 100 years [crosstalk 00:02:10]-, 100 million dollars., I never said that at all-, They made it up., You make up a lot-, Wait a minute, Chris. So why didn’t he do it for 47 years? You were vice president-, So why didn’t you get the world… China sends up real dirt into the air. Russia does. India does. They all do. We’re supposed to be good. And by the way, he made a couple of statements. The Green New Deal is a hundred trillion dollars., He made a statement about the military. He said I said something about the military. He and his friends made it up, and then they went with it. I never said it., He called the military stupid bastards., He said it on tape. [crosstalk 00:58:32]-, I would never say that [crosstalk 00:58:35]-, You’re on tape-, Oh, you don’t? Oh, well, that’s a big statement., You just lost the radical left., So when I listen to Joe talking about a transition, there has been no transition from when I won. I won that election. And if you look at crooked Hillary Clinton, if you look at all of the different people, there was no transition, because they came after me trying to do a coup. They came after me spying on my campaign. They started from the day I won, and even before I won. From the day I came down the escalator with our first lady, they were a disaster. They were a disgrace to our country, and we’ve caught them. We’ve caught them all. We’ve got it all on tape. We’ve caught them all. And by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan Act against General Flynn. You better take a look at that, because we caught you in a sense, and President Obama was sitting in the office., He knew about it too. So don’t tell me about a free transition. As far as the ballots are concerned, it’s a disaster. A solicited ballot, okay, solicited, is okay. You’re soliciting. You’re asking. They send it back. You send it back. I did that. If you have an unsolicited… They’re sending millions of ballots all over the country. There’s fraud. They found them in creeks. They found some, just happened to have the name Trump just the other day in a wastepaper basket. They’re being sent all over the place. They sent two in a Democrat area. They sent out a thousand ballots. Everybody got two ballots. This is going to be a fraud like you’ve never seen. The other thing, it’s nice. On November 3rd, you’re watching, and you see who won the election. And I think we’re going to do well because people are really happy with the job we’ve done., But you know what? We won’t know. We might not know for months because these ballots are going to be all over. Take a look at what happened in Manhattan. Take a look at what happened in New Jersey. Take a look at what happened in Virginia and other places. They’re not losing 2%, 1%, which by the way is too much. An election could be won or lost with that. They’re losing 30 and 40%. It’s a fraud, and it’s a shame. And can you imagine where they say, “You have to have your ballot in by November 10th.” November 10th. That’s seven days after the election, in theory, should have been announced. We have major states [crosstalk 01:03:58] with that-, … all run by Democrats-, All run by Democrats., It’s a rigged election., Yeah. I think I’m counting on them to look at the ballots, definitely. I hope we don’t need them, in terms of the election itself. But for the ballots, I think so, because what’s happening is incredible. I read today where at least 1% of the ballots for 2016 were invalidated. They take them. We don’t like them. We don’t like them. They throw them out-, … left and right., What you do is you go and vote. You do a solicited ballot, and that’s okay-, You go and vote. You go and vote-, You either do, Chris, a solicited ballot, where you’re sending it in, they’re sending it back and you’re sending. They have mailmen with lots of it. Did you see what’s going on? Take a look at West Virginia, mailman selling the ballots. They’re being sold. They’re being dumped in rivers. This is a horrible thing for our country., This is not going to end well., This is not going to end well-, You’re wrong. You’re wrong [crosstalk 01:06:04]. I love counting the votes [crosstalk 01:06:05]-, Chris, he’s so wrong when he makes a statement like that-, Excuse me [crosstalk 01:07:11]-, You know it can’t be done. You know it can’t, and already, there’s been fraud [crosstalk 01:07:19]-, Could be months-, I’m urging my supporters to go in to the polls and watch very carefully, because that’s what has to happen. I am urging them to do it. As you know, today there was a big problem. In Philadelphia, they went in to watch. They’re called poll watchers, a very safe, very nice thing. They were thrown out. They weren’t allowed to watch. You know why? Because bad things happen in Philadelphia. Bad things. And I am urging my people. I hope it’s going to be a fair election. If it’s a fair election-, … I am 100% on board. But if I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can’t go along with that. And I’ll tell you why-, … from a common sense-, I’ll tell you what it means-, It means you have a fraudulent election. You’re sending out 80 million ballots-, They’re not equipped… These people aren’t equipped to handle it, number one. Number two, they cheat. They cheat. Hey, they found ballots in a wastepaper basket three days ago, and they all had the name military ballots. There were military. They all had the name Trump on them., You think that’s good?, It’s already been established. Take a look at Carolyn Maloney’s race-, I want to see an honest ballot cut-, I want to see an honest ballot count., And I think he does

doing thank you very much chris i will tell you very simply we won the election elections have consequences we have the senate we have the white house and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all top top academic good in every way good in every way in fact some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from notre dame and other places so i think she s going to be fantastic we have plenty of time even if we did it after the election itself i have a lot of time after the election as you know so i think that she will be outstanding she s going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court we really feel that we have a professor at notre dame highly respected by all said she s the single greatest student he s ever had he s been a professor for a long time at a great school and we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her and very few people knowingly would say otherwise and by the way the democrats they wouldn t even think about not doing it the only difference is they d try and do it faster there s no way they would give it up they had merrick garland but the problem is they didn t have the election so they were stopped and probably that would happen in reverse also definitely would happen in reverse so we won the election and we have the right to do it chris thank you joe there aren t a hundred million people with pre existing conditions as far as a say is concerned the people already had their say okay justice ginsburg said very powerfully very strongly at some point years ago or so she said a president and the senate is elected for a period of time but a president is elected for four years we re not elected for three years i m not elected for three years so we have the senate we have a president during that period of time during that period of time we have an opening i m not elected for three years i m elected for four years joe the hundred million people is totally wrong i don t know where you got that number the bigger problem that you have is that you re going to extinguish million people with their private health care that they re very happy this well you re certainly going to socialist you re going to socialist that s not what you ve said and it s not what your party is saying your party doesn t say it your party wants to go socialist medicine and socialist healthcare and they re going to dominate you joe you know that not according to harris joe you ve had military people dying because you couldn t provide them proper healthcare in the military so don t tell me about this and if you were here it wouldn t be it would be two million people because you were very late on the draw you didn t want me to ban china which was heavily infected you didn t want me to ban europe you would have been much later joe much later we re talking about two million people you don t know what s on the ballot why is it on the ballot why is it on the ballot it s not on the ballot i don t think so there s nothing happening there you don t know her view on roe v wade you don t know here view that s right because they want to give good healthcare yes i have of course i have the individual mandate excuse me i got rid of the individual mandate which was a big chunk of obamacare that is absolutely a big thing that was the worst part of obamacare chris that was the worst part of obamacare well i ll ask joe the individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of obamacare i got rid of it and we will protect people go ahead well first of all i guess i m debating you not him but that s okay i m not surprised let me just tell you something there s nothing symbolic i m cutting drug prices i m going with favored nations which no president has the courage to do because you re going against big pharma drug prices will be coming down or you could have done it during your year period in government but you didn t do it nobody s done it so we re cutting healthcare all of the things that we ve done i ll give you an example insulin it was destroying families destroying people the cost i m getting it for so cheap it s like water you want to know the truth so cheap take a look at all of the drugs that what we re doing prescription drug prices we re going to allow our governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they paid just a tiny fraction of what we do this is big stuff that s not what your party says by the way joe you agreed with bernie sanders who s far left on the manifesto we call it and that gives you socialized medicine are you saying you didn t agree not by much not by much if pocahontas would have left two days early you would have lost every primary on super tuesday you got very lucky with what with what but you agree joe you re the liar you graduated last in your class not first in your class you d be surprised you d be surprised go ahead joe listen you agreed with bernie sanders and the manifesto he just lost the left you just lost the left you agreed with bernie sanders on a plan that you absolutely agreed to and under that plan crosstalk they call it socialized medicine who is bernie no i want to give them better healthcare at a much lower price because obamacare is no good i ve already fixed it we ve already fixed it to an extent obamacare as you might know but probably don t obamacare is no good obamacare is no good we made it better and i had a choice to make very early on we took away the individual mandate we guaranteed pre existing conditions but took away the individual mandate listen this is the way it is and that destroyed they shouldn t even call it obamacare then i had a choice to make do i let my people run it really well or badly if i run it badly they ll probably blame him but they ll blame me but more importantly i want to help people okay i said you ve got to run it so well and i just had a meeting with them they said the problem is no matter how well you run obamacare it s a disaster it s too expensive premiums are too high that it doesn t work so we do want to get rid of it chris we want to get rid of that and give something that s cheaper and better go ahead good of course we do are you going to pack the court are you going to pack the court he doesn t want to answer the question why wouldn t you answer that question you want to put a lot of new supreme court justices radical left listen who is on your list joe who s on your list he s going to pack the court he is not going to give a list the people understand joe years you ve done nothing they re understand wrong wrong it s so wrong so if we would have listened to you if we would ve listened to you the country would have been left wide open millions of people would have died not and one person is too much it s china s fault it should have never happened they stopped it from going in but it was china s fault and by the way when you talk about numbers you don t know how many people died in china you don t know how many people died in russia you don t know how many people died in india they don t exactly give you a straight count just so you understand but if you look at what we ve done i closed it and you said he s xenophobic he s a racist and he s xenophobic because you didn t think i should have closed our country wait a minute you didn t think we should have closed our country because you thought it was terrible you wouldn t have closed it for another two months by my doing it early in fact dr fauci said president trump saved thousands of lives many of your democrat governors said president trump did a phenomenal job we worked with the governor oh really go take a look the governors said i did a phenomenal job most of them said that in fact people that would not be necessarily on my side said that president trump did a phenomenal job we did we got the gowns we got the masks we made the ventilators you wouldn t have made ventilators and now we re weeks away from a vaccine we re doing therapeutics already fewer people are dying when they get sick far fewer people are dying we ve done a great job the only thing i haven t done a good job and that s because of the fake news no matter what you say to them they give you a bad press on it it s just fake news they give you good press they give me bad press because that s the way it is unfortunately but let me just say something i don t care i ve gotten used to it but i ll tell you joe you could never have done the job that we did you don t have it in your blood you could ve never done that joe well you didn t do very well in swine flu h n you were a disaster your own chief of staff said you were a disaster a far less lethal disease by the way we would have lost far more people far more people you would have been months late you re months behind me joe you don t trust johnson johnson pfizer well i ve spoken to the companies and we can have it a lot sooner it s a very political thing because people like this would rather make it political than save lives it is a very political thing i ve spoken to pfizer i ve spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to moderna johnson johnson and others they can go faster than that by a lot it s become very political because the left or i don t know if i call them left i don t know what i call them i disagree with him no i disagree with both of them and he didn t say that he said it could be there but it could also be much sooner i had him in my office two days ago because he said it s a possibility that we ll have the answer before november st it could also be after that well we re going to deliver it right away we have the military all set up logistically they re all set up we have our military that delivers soldiers and they can do a day they re going to be delivering it s all set up that was said sarcastically and you know that that was said sarcastically you ll have the vaccine sooner than that we spoke to the scientists that are in charge they will have the vaccine very soon did you use the word smart so you said you went to delaware state but you forgot the name of your college you didn t go to delaware state you graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class don t ever use the word smart with me don t ever use that word because you know what there s nothing smart about you joe years you ve done nothing let me just tell you something joe if you would have had the charge of what i was put through i had to close the greatest economy of the history of our country and by the way now it s being built again and it s going up fast okay it s going up fast i look forward to talking about it tell that to nancy pelosi tell that to nancy pelosi and schumer crosstalk chuck you probably play more than i do joe well he wants to shut down this country and i want to keep it open and we did a great thing by shutting it down wait a minute joe let me shut you down for a second joe just for one second he wants to shut down the country we just went through it we had to because we didn t know anything about the disease now we ve found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very very vulnerable we learned a lot young children aren t even younger people aren t we ve learned a lot but he wants to shut it down more people will be hurt by continuing if you look at pennsylvania if you look at certain states that have been shut down they have democrat governors all one of the reasons they shut down is because they want to keep it shut down until after the election on november rd because it s a political thing but those states those states are not doing well that are shut down right now he wants to shut down the whole country no i think masks are okay you have to understand if you look i mean i have a mask right here i put a mask on when i think i need it tonight as an example everybody s had a test and you ve had social distancing and all of the things that you have to but i wear masks when needed when needed i wear masks i don t wear a mask like him every time you see him he s got a mask he could be speaking feet away from him and he shows up with the biggest mask i ve ever seen i will say this and they ve also said the opposite they ve also said dr fauci dr fauci said the opposite he said very strongly masks are not good then he changed his mind he said masks are good i m okay with masks i m not fighting masks outside because nobody will show up well it s true nobody shows up to his rallies because people want to hear what i have to say i mean i m doing my job as a president and i ll have people show up at airports we use airports and hangers and we have a lot of people well so far we have had no problem whatsoever it s outside that s a big difference according to the experts we do them outside we have tremendous crowds as you see and literally on hours notice and joe does the circles and has three people someplace we ve had no negative effect we ve had no negative effect and we ve had people at these rallies if you could get the crowds you would have done the same thing but you can t nobody cares no cares yes much faster so we built the greatest economy in history we closed it down because of the china plague when the plague came in we closed it down which was very hard psychologically to do he didn t think we should close it down and he was wrong again two million people would be dead now instead of still people is too much one person is too much should have never happened from china but what happened is we closed it down and now we re reopening and we re doing record business we had million people in a four month period that we ve put back into the workforce that s a record the likes of which nobody s ever seen before and he wants to close down the he will shut it down again he will destroy this country a lot of people between drugs and alcohol and depression when you start shutting it down you take a look at what s happening at some of your democrat run states where they have these tough shutdowns and i m telling you it s because they don t want to open it one of them came out last week you saw that oh we re going to open up on november th why november th because it s after the election they think they re hurting us by keeping them closed they re hurting people people know what to do they can social distance they can wash their hands they can wear masks they can do whatever they want but they got to open these states up when you look at north carolina when you look and these governors are under siege pennsylvania michigan and a couple of others you got to open these states up it s not fair you re talking about almost it s like being in prison and you look at what s going on with divorce look at what s going on with alcoholism and drugs it s a very very sad thing and he ll close down the whole country this guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country our country is coming back incredibly well setting records as it does it we don t need somebody to come in and say let s shut it down that s wrong crosstalk i have to respond to that excuse me he made a statement no people want their schools open they don t want to be shut down they don t want their state shut down they want their restaurants i look at new york it s so sad what s happening in new york it s almost like a ghost town and i m not sure it can ever recover what they ve done to new york people want their places open they want to get back to their lives they ll be careful but they want their schools open i m the one that brought back football by the way i brought back big ten football it was me and i m very happy to do it and people of ohio are very proud of me and you know how i found out when crosstalk i paid millions of dollars in taxes millions of dollars of income tax and let me just tell you there was a story in one of the papers that paid i paid million one year i paid million one year you ll see it as soon as it s finished you ll see it you know if you wanted to go to the board of elections there s page or so report that says everything i have every bank i have i m totally under leveraged because the assets are extremely good and i built a great company but let me tell you let me millions of dollars millions of dollars yes millions of dollars and you ll get to see it and you ll get to see it but let me just tell you chris let me just say something that it was the tax laws i don t want to pay tax before i came here i was a private developer i was a private business people like every other private person unless they re stupid they go through the laws and that s what it is he passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation and for tax credits we build the building and we get tax credits like the hotel on pennsylvania avenue which by the way was given to me by the obama administration if you can believe that now the man got fired right after that happened but that s that s okay but why didn t you do it over the last years why didn t you do it over the last years you were a senator and crosstalk hey joe let me just tell you joe in months i ve done more than you ve done in years joe we ve done things that you never even thought of doing including fixing the broken military that you gave me including taking care of your debts he has none why didn t you do it before when you were vice president with obama i got it done and you know what happened our economy boomed like it s never boomed before excuse me they had the slowest economic recovery since it was the slowest recovery also they took over something that was down here all you had to do is turn on the lights and you pick up a lot but they had the slowest economic recovery since and let me tell you about the stock market when the stock market goes up that means jobs it also means ks if you got in if you ever became president with your ideas you want to terminate my taxes i ll tell you what you ll lose half of the companies that have poured in here will leave and plenty of companies that are already here they ll leave for other places crosstalk they will leave and you will have a depression the likes of which you ve never seen it wasn t blooming he was in booming it was the weakest recovery since when covid came along excuse me chris wait chris they said it would take no you re on number two chris chris they said it would take a miracle to bring back manufacturing i brought back jobs they brought back nothing they gave up on manufacturing standard fare he totally gave up on manufacturing ohio had the best year it s ever had last year michigan had the best year they ve ever had many car companies came in from germany from japan went to michigan went to ohio and they didn t come in with you crosstalk china ate your lunch crosstalk china ate your lunch joe and no wonder your son goes in and he takes out billions of dollars he takes out billions of dollars to manage he makes millions of dollars and also while we re at it why is it just out of curiosity the mayor of moscow s wife gave you a son three and a half million dollars what did he do to deserve it what did he do with to deserve oh really he didn t get three and a half million well wait he didn t get three and a half million dollars joe he got three and a half million dollars oh really it s a fact did burisma pay him a month with no experience in energy i think he did by who the media by the media because they refuse to talk about it because they re embarrassed so let me ask you this joe crosstalk he got three and a half million dollars from moscow oh really i d like to know who they are i ll fire them some people don t do a good job hey let me just tell you joe three and a half million joe why did he deserve three and a half million from moscow my family my family lost a fortune by coming down and helping us with governance every single one of them lost a fortune chris can i be honest it s a very important question he stood up and the threatened ukraine with a billion dollars well and him too well that s all right but he does plenty he does plenty oh yeah sure that s true so you did a crime bill where you call them super predators african americans are super predators and they ve never forgotten it they ve never forgotten it so you did that and they call you a super predator and i m letting people out of jail now that you have treated the african american population community you have treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country you did the and that s why if you look at the polls i m doing better than any republican has done in a long time because they saw what you did you call them super predators and you ve called them worse than that because you look back at your testimony over the years you ve called them a lot worse than that as far as the church is concerned and as far as the generals are concerned we just got the support of military leaders and generals total support law enforcement almost every law enforcement group in the united states i have florida i have texas i have ohio i have every excuse me portland the sheriff just came out today and he said i support president trump i don t think you have any law enforcement you can t even say the word law enforcement because if you say those words you re going to lose all of your radical left supporters and why aren t you saying those words joe why don t you say the words law enforcement because you know what if called us in portland we would put out that fire in a half an hour but they won t do it because they re run by radical left democrats if you look at chicago if you look at any place you want to look seattle they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back seattle minneapolis we got it back joe because we believe in law and order but you don t the top cities and just about the top cities are run by democrats and in many cases radical left and they ve got you wrapped around their finger joe to a point where you don t want to say anything about law and order and i ll tell you what the people of this country want and demand law and order and you re afraid to even say it what is peaceful protest when they run through the middle of the town and burn down your stores and kill people all over the place crosstalk no it s not but you say it is fine i ended it because it s racist i ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane that it a radical revolution that was taking place in our military in our schools all over the place and you know it and so does everybody else and he would know it crosstalk if you were a certain person you had no status in life it was sort of a reversal and if you look at the people we were paying people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly very sick ideas and really they were teaching people to hate our country and i m not going to do that i m not going to allow that to happen we have to go back to the core values of this country they were teaching people that our country is a horrible place it s a racist place and they were teaching people to hate our country and i m not going to allow that to happen you just don t know during the obama biden administration there was tremendous division there was hatred you look at ferguson you look at or you go to very many places look at oakland look what happened in oakland look what happened in baltimore look what happened frankly it was more violent than what i m even seeing now but the reason is that the democrats that run these cities don t want to talk like you about law and order and you still haven t mentioned are you in favor of law and order are you in favor of law and order crosstalk okay it went down much more in ours the places we had trouble were democratic run cities i think as a party issue you can bring in a couple of examples but if you look at chicago what s going on in chicago where a people were shot and eight died shot if you look at new york where it s going up like nobody s ever seen anything the numbers are going up a crime it is crazy what s going on and he doesn t want to say law and order because he can t because he ll lose his radical left supporters and once he does that it s over with but if he ever got to run this country and they ran it the way he would want to run it we would have by the way our suburbs would be gone and you would see problems like you ve never seen before oh i know suburbs so much that you that s not what they are talking about this that s not what it is about he s talking about defunding the police he doesn t have any law support he has no law enforcement he has almost nothing oh really who do you have name one group that supports you name one group that came out and supported you go ahead think we have time no no think right now name one law enforcement group that came out in support of you there aren t any he s never done that oh really i sent in the us marshalls to get the killer of a young man in the middle of the street and they shot him for three days portland didn t do anything i sent in the us marshals they took care of business i don t know who said that who i don t think she said that i don t think so does it mean i have to answer his stuff wait a second you have made a statement i would love to end it i ll send in the national guard it would be over that d be no problem but i don t want to accept the national guard sure i m will to do that i would say almost everything i see is from the left wing not from the right wing i m willing to do anything i want to see peace what do you want to call them give me a name give me a name go ahead who do you want me to condemn proud boys stand back and stand by but i ll tell you what somebody s got to do something about antifa and the left because this is not a right wing problem this is a left wing oh you got to be kidding me well then you know what he s wrong antifa is bad you know what antifa is a dangerous radical group and you ought to be careful of them they ll over throw you because there is never been an administration or president who has done more than i ve done in a period of three and a half years and that s despite the impeachment hoax and you so what happened today with hillary clinton where it was a whole big con job but despite going through all of these things where i had a fight both flanks and behind me and above there has never been an administration that s done what i ve done the greatest before covid came in the greatest economy in history lowest unemployment numbers everything was good everything was going and by the way there was unity going to happen people were calling me for the first time in years they were calling and they were saying it s time maybe and then what happened we got hit but now we re building it back up again a rebuilding of the military including space force and all of the other things a fixing of the va which was a mess under him people died because they didn t have proper health care it was a mess and we now got a approval rating at the va our vets we take care of our vets but we ve rebuilt our military and i ll tell you something some people say maybe the most important by the end of the first term i ll have approximately federal judges and court of appeals judges and hopefully three great supreme court judges justices that is a record the likes of which very few people and one of the reasons i ll have so many judges because president obama and him left me judges to fill when you leave office you don t leave any judges that s like you just don t do that they left openings and if i were a member of his party because they have a little different philosophy i d say if you left us openings you can t be a good president you can t be a good vice president but i want to thank you because it gives us almost it ll probably be above that number by the end of this term judges it s a record you son got three and a half million dollars really are you talking hunter are you talking about hunter i don t know beau i know hunter hunter got thrown out of the military he was thrown out dishonorably discharged for cocaine use and he didn t have a job until you became vice president once you became vice president he made a fortune in ukraine in china in moscow and various other places he made a fortune and he didn t have a job but why was he given tens of millions of dollars i know but when somebody gets three and a half million dollars from the mayor of moscow why did he get it i want crystal clean water and air i want beautiful clean air we have now the lowest carbon if you look at our numbers right now we are doing phenomenally but i haven t destroyed our businesses our businesses aren t put out of commission if you look at the paris accord it was a disaster from our standpoint and people are actually very happy about what s going on because our businesses are doing well as far as the fires are concerned you need forest management in addition to everything else the forest floors are loaded up with trees dead trees that are years old and they re like tinder and leaves and everything else you drop a cigarette in there the whole forest burns down you ve got to have forest management i believe that we have to do everything we can to have immaculate air immaculate water and do whatever else we can that s good we re planting a billion trees the billion tree project and it s very exciting for a lot of people i think a lot of things do but i think to an extent yes i think to an extent yes but i also think we have to do better management of our forest every year i get the call california s burning california s burning if that was cleaned if that were if you had forest management good forest management you wouldn t be getting those calls in europe they live they re forest cities they call forest cities they maintain their forest they manage their forest i was with the head of a major country it s a forest city he said sir we have trees that are far more they ignite much easier than california there shouldn t be that problem i spoke with the governor about it i m getting along very well with the governor but i said at some point you can t every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burned to the ground that s burning down because of a lack of management because it was driving energy prices through the sky well not really because what s happening is the car is much less expensive and it s a much safer car and you talk it about a tiny difference and then what would happen because of the cost of the car you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased we have the old slugs out there that are years old if you did that the car would be safer it would be much cheaper by no but you would take a lot of cars off the market because people would be able to afford a car now by the way we re going to see how that turns out but a lot of people agree with me many people the car has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit of gasoline and i m okay with electric cars too i think i m all for electric cars i ve given big incentives for electric cars but what they ve done in california is just crazy not true not true he s talking about the green new deal and it s not billion crosstalk or billion as you said crosstalk it s trillion and rebuild the building it s the dumbest most ridiculous crosstalk where two car systems are out where they want to take out the cows too that s not true either right this is a trillion that s more money than our country could make in years crosstalk million dollars i never said that at all they made it up you make up a lot wait a minute chris so why didn t he do it for years you were vice president so why didn t you get the world china sends up real dirt into the air russia does india does they all do we re supposed to be good and by the way he made a couple of statements the green new deal is a hundred trillion dollars he made a statement about the military he said i said something about the military he and his friends made it up and then they went with it i never said it he called the military stupid bastards he said it on tape crosstalk i would never say that crosstalk you re on tape oh you don t oh well that s a big statement you just lost the radical left so when i listen to joe talking about a transition there has been no transition from when i won i won that election and if you look at crooked hillary clinton if you look at all of the different people there was no transition because they came after me trying to do a coup they came after me spying on my campaign they started from the day i won and even before i won from the day i came down the escalator with our first lady they were a disaster they were a disgrace to our country and we ve caught them we ve caught them all we ve got it all on tape we ve caught them all and by the way you gave the idea for the logan act against general flynn you better take a look at that because we caught you in a sense and president obama was sitting in the office he knew about it too so don t tell me about a free transition as far as the ballots are concerned it s a disaster a solicited ballot okay solicited is okay you re soliciting you re asking they send it back you send it back i did that if you have an unsolicited they re sending millions of ballots all over the country there s fraud they found them in creeks they found some just happened to have the name trump just the other day in a wastepaper basket they re being sent all over the place they sent two in a democrat area they sent out a thousand ballots everybody got two ballots this is going to be a fraud like you ve never seen the other thing it s nice on november rd you re watching and you see who won the election and i think we re going to do well because people are really happy with the job we ve done but you know what we won t know we might not know for months because these ballots are going to be all over take a look at what happened in manhattan take a look at what happened in new jersey take a look at what happened in virginia and other places they re not losing which by the way is too much an election could be won or lost with that they re losing and it s a fraud and it s a shame and can you imagine where they say you have to have your ballot in by november th november th that s seven days after the election in theory should have been announced we have major states crosstalk with that all run by democrats all run by democrats it s a rigged election yeah i think i m counting on them to look at the ballots definitely i hope we don t need them in terms of the election itself but for the ballots i think so because what s happening is incredible i read today where at least of the ballots for were invalidated they take them we don t like them we don t like them they throw them out left and right what you do is you go and vote you do a solicited ballot and that s okay you go and vote you go and vote you either do chris a solicited ballot where you re sending it in they re sending it back and you re sending they have mailmen with lots of it did you see what s going on take a look at west virginia mailman selling the ballots they re being sold they re being dumped in rivers this is a horrible thing for our country this is not going to end well this is not going to end well you re wrong you re wrong crosstalk i love counting the votes crosstalk chris he s so wrong when he makes a statement like that excuse me crosstalk you know it can t be done you know it can t and already there s been fraud crosstalk could be months i m urging my supporters to go in to the polls and watch very carefully because that s what has to happen i am urging them to do it as you know today there was a big problem in philadelphia they went in to watch they re called poll watchers a very safe very nice thing they were thrown out they weren t allowed to watch you know why because bad things happen in philadelphia bad things and i am urging my people i hope it s going to be a fair election if it s a fair election i am on board but if i see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated i can t go along with that and i ll tell you why from a common sense i ll tell you what it means it means you have a fraudulent election you re sending out million ballots they re not equipped these people aren t equipped to handle it number one number two they cheat they cheat hey they found ballots in a wastepaper basket three days ago and they all had the name military ballots there were military they all had the name trump on them you think that s good it s already been established take a look at carolyn maloney s race i want to see an honest ballot cut i want to see an honest ballot count and i think he does too

you doing, man?, I’m well., Well, first of all, thank you for doing this and looking forward to this, Mr. President., The American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for United States Senators and when they vote for the President of United States. They’re not going to get that chance now because we’re in the middle of an election already. The election has already started. Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that’s the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President., Now, what’s at stake here is the President’s made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He’s been running on that, he ran on that and he’s been governing on that. He’s in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court. And the justice, I’m not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person. But she’s written, before she went in the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not Constitutional. The other thing that’s on the court, and if it’s struck down, what happens? Women’s rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could pay more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. They’re able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets., And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act, and there’s a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and they’ll be taken away as well. Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. And so it’s just not appropriate to do this before this election. If he wins the election and the Senate is Republican, then he goes forward. If not, we should wait until February., He’s elected to the next election., That’s simply not true., Open discussion., Number one, he knows what I proposed. What I proposed is that we expand Obamacare and we increase it. We do not wipe any. And one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that I won, were saying that Biden wanted to allow people to have private insurance still. They can. They do. They will under my proposal., That is simply a lie., The party is me. Right now, I am the Democratic Party., I am the Democratic Party right now., The platform of the Democratic Party is what I, in fact, approved of, what I approved of. Now, here’s the deal. The deal is that it’s going to wipe out pre-existing conditions. And, by the way, the 200,000 people that have died on his watch, how many of those have survived? Well, there’s seven million people that contracted COVID. What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act?, I’m happy to talk about this., You’re not going to be able to shut him up., Let me finish. The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe V. Wade. That’s on the ballot as well and the court, in the court, and so that’s also at stake right now. And so the election is all-, It’s on the ballot in the court., In the court., Donald would you just be quiet for a minute., All right., Good healthcare., He has not done healthcare., Yes., It is not., It does not. It’s only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid they can get that free in most States, except Governors who want to deny people who are poor Medicaid. Anyone who qualifies for Medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option. The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option. Number one. Number two., Look, hey., I’m not going to listen to him. The fact of the matter is I beat Bernie Sanders., I beat him by a whole hell of a lot., I’m here standing facing you, old buddy., All he knows how to do-, Look he’s the deal. I got very lucky. I’m going to get very lucky tonight as well., And tonight I’m going to make sure., Because here’s the deal, here’s the deal. The fact is that everything he’s saying so far is simply a lie. I’m not here to call out his lies. Everybody knows he’s a liar., God, I want to make sure-, No, he doesn’t know how to do that., The wrong guy, the wrong night, at the wrong time., There is no manifesto, number one., Number two., Number two., I’ll tell you what, he is not for any help for people needing healthcare., Because he, in fact, already has costs 10 million people their healthcare that they had from their employers because of his recession. Number one. Number two, there are 20 million people getting healthcare through Obamacare now that he wants to take it away. He won’t ever look you in the eye and say that’s what he wants to do. Take it away., He doesn’t know how. He doesn’t know how to do that., He has never offered a plan., He has no plan for healthcare., He sends out wishful thinking. He has Executive Orders that have no power. He hasn’t lowered drug costs for anybody. He’s been promising a healthcare plan since he got elected. He has none, like almost everything else he talks about. He does not have a plan. He doesn’t have a plan. And the fact is this man doesn’t know what he’s talking about. [crosstalk 00:17:14]., Sure., Whatever position I take on that, that’ll become the issue. The issue is the American people should speak. You should go out and vote. You’re voting now. Vote and let your Senators know strongly how you feel., Vote now., Make sure you, in fact, let people know, your Senators., I’m not going to answer the question., Will you shut up, man?, This is so un-Presidential., That was really a productive segment, wasn’t it? Keep yapping, man., They sure do., Good luck. 200,000 dead. As you said, over seven million infected in the United States. We, in fact, have 4% of the world’s population, 20% of the deaths. 40,000 people a day are contracting COVID. In addition to that, about between 750 and 1000 people a day are dying. When he was presented with that number, he said, “It is what it is.” Well, it is what it is because you are who you are. That’s why it is. The President has no plan. He hasn’t laid out anything. He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was. He knew it was a deadly disease. What did he do? He’s on tape as acknowledging he knew it. He said he didn’t tell us or give people a warning of it because he didn’t want to panic the American people. You don’t panic. He panicked. In addition to that, what did he do?, He went in and we were insisting that the people we had in the ground in China should be able to go to Wuhan and determine for themselves how dangerous this was. He did not even ask Xi to do that., He told us what a great job Xi was doing. He said we owe him debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us. And what did he do then? He then did nothing. He waited and waited and waited. He still doesn’t have a plan., I laid out back in March, exactly what we should be doing. And I laid out again in July, what we should be doing. We should be providing all the protective gear possible. We should be providing the money the House has passed in order to be able to go out and get people the help they need to keep their businesses open. Open schools cost a lot of money. You should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap in your golf course and go in the Oval Office and bring together the Democrats and Republicans and fund what needs to be done now to save lives., I know how to do the job. I know how to get the job done., 14,000 people died, not 200,000., And there was no one … We didn’t shut down the economy. This is his economy he shut down. The reason it’s shut down is because, look, you folks at home. How many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died of COVID? How many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn’t even speak to them, you had a nurse holding a phone up so you could in fact say goodbye?, His own CDC Director says we could lose as many as another 200,000 people between now and the end of the year. And he said, if we just wear a mask, we can save half those numbers. Just a mask. And by the way, in terms of the whole notion of a vaccine, we’re for a vaccine, but I don’t trust him at all. Nor do you. I know you don’t. What we trust is a scientist., God., This is the same man who told you-, … by Easter, this would be gone away. By the warm weather, it’d be gone. Miraculous, like a miracle. And by the way, maybe you could inject some bleach in your arm, and that would take care of it. This is the same man., So here’s the deal. This man is talking about a vaccine. Every serious company is talking about maybe having a vaccine done by the end of the year, but the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning of the middle of next year to get it out, if we get the vaccine. And pray God we will. Pray God we will., No more than the question you just asked him. You pointed out he puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientists., Everybody knows-, Well, no, no. You can trust the scientist. She didn’t say that. You can trust the-, Yes. Well, that’s what he’s going to try to do, but there’s thousands of scientists out there, like here at this great hospital that don’t work for him. Their job doesn’t depend on him. They’re the people… And by the way-, By the way-, Do you believe for a moment what he’s telling you in light of all the lies he’s told you about the whole issue relating to COVID? He still hasn’t even acknowledged that he knew this was happening, knew how dangerous it was going to be back in February, and he didn’t even tell you. He’s on record as saying it. He panicked or he just looked at the stock market. One of the two. Because guess what? A lot of people died and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter, a lot quicker-, Oh, give me a break., Well, let’s have this debate-, Because he doesn’t have a plan. If I were running it, I’d know what the plan is. You’ve got to provide these businesses the ability to have the money to be able to reopen with the PPE, as well as with the sanitation they need. You have to provide them classic-, Will he just shush for a minute?, Nancy Pelosi and Schumer, they have a plan. He won’t even meet with them. The Republicans won’t meet in the Senate. He sits in his golf course. Well, I mean, literally, think about it. Think about it., You just admitted you’d shut it down., I got to respond to that., I got to respond to that., Just like your rally., Look, the way to open businesses is give them the wherewithal to be able open. We provided money, the-, Well, masks make a big difference. His own head of the CDC said if we just wore masks between now, if everybody wore a mask and social distanced between now and January, we’d probably save up to 100,000 lives. It matters. It matters., No serious person has said the opposite. No serious person., He did not say the opposite., By the way, did you see one of the last big rallies he had? A reporter came up to him to ask him a question, he said, “No, no, no. Stand back, put on your mask, put on a mask. Have you been tested? I’m way far away from those other people.” That’s what he said, “I’m going to be okay.” He’s not worried about you. He’s not worried about the people out there [crosstalk 00:08:48]., No negative effect. Come on., Yes, I would. He’s been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing and people wearing masks, basically encouraged them not to. He’s a fool on this., The difference is millionaires and billionaires like him in the middle of the COVID crisis have done very well. Billionaires have made another $300 billion because of his profligate tax proposal, and he only focused on the market. But you folks at home, you folks living in Scranton and Claymont and all the small towns and working class towns in America, how well are you doing? This guy paid a total of $750 in taxes., Do I get my time back? The fact is that he has in fact, worked on this in a way that he’s going to be the first president of the United States to leave office, having fewer jobs in his administration than when he became president. Fewer jobs than when he became president. First one in American history., Secondly, the people who have lost their jobs are those people who have been on the front lines. Those people who have been saving our lives, those people who have been out there dying. People who’ve been putting themselves in the way to make sure that we could all try to make it. And the idea that he is insisting that we go forward and open when you have almost half the states in America with a significant increase in COVID deaths and COVID cases in the United States of America, and he wants to open it up more. Why is he want to open it up? Why does he take care of the… You can’t fix the economy until you fix the COVID crisis. And he has no intention of doing anything about making it better for you all at home in terms of your health and your safety., Schools. Why aren’t schools open? Because it costs a lot of money to open them safely. They were going to give, his administration going to give the teachers and school students masks, and then they decided no, couldn’t do that because it’s not a national emergency. Not a national emergency. They’ve done nothing to help small businesses. Nothing. They’re closing. One in six is now gone. He ought to get on the job and take care of the needs of the American people so we can open safely., People want to be safe., People want to be safe., Show us your tax returns., Show us your tax returns., Release your tax return., When?, In [crosstalk 00:16:04]?, Yeah, I do want to respond. Look, the tax code that put him in a position that he pays less tax than on the money a school teacher makes is because of him… He says he’s smart because he can take advantage of the tax code. And he does take advantage of the tax code. That’s why I’m going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts. And I’m going to eliminate those tax cuts., And make sure that we invest in the people who in fact need the help. People out there need help., Because you weren’t president-, Because you weren’t president and screwing things up., You’re the worst president America has ever had. Come on., Well, just take a look at what is the analysis done by Wall Street firms, points out that my economic plan would create 7 million more jobs than his in four years, number one. And number two, it would create an additional $1 trillion in economic growth, because it would be about buying American. The federal government spends $600 billion a year on everything from ships, to steel, to buildings and the like. And under my proposal, we’re going to make sure that every penny of that has to be made by a company-, By the way, I’m going to eliminate a significant number of the taxes. I’m going to make the corporate tax 28%. It shouldn’t be 21%. You have 91 companies federal, I mean, the fortune 500, who don’t pay a single penny in tax making billions of dollars., Because you in fact passed that, that was your tax proposal., Yeah, you got it done-, The economy-, Let me finish., Not lower tax for the American people., Look-, … we inherited the worst recession, short of a depression in American history. I was asked to bring it back. We were able to have an economic recovery that created the jobs you’re talking about. We handed him a booming economy, he blew it., He blew it., Yeah, because what he did, even before COVID, manufacturing went in the hole. Manufacturing went in a hole-, … number one. Number two-, Number three., No., This guy-, We did not. [crosstalk 00:21:21], I’m the guy that brought back the automobile industry., I was asked to bring back Chrysler and General Motors. He brought them back right here in the state of Ohio and Michigan. He blew it. They’re gone. He blew it. And in fact, they’re gone-, That is not true., And so you take a look at what he’s actually done. He’s done very little. His trade deals are the same way. He talks about these great trade deals. He talks about the art of the deal. China’s perfected the art of the steel. We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before. We have the highest trade deficit-, … with Mexico., That is not true., None of that is true., None of that is true., Is totally-, Totally discredited. Totally discredited. And by the way-, Mr. Vice-, That is not true., It is not a fact., It’s been totally discredited., My son did nothing wrong at Barisma-, He doesn’t want to let me answer, because he knows I have the truth. His position has been totally thoroughly discredited-, And you can-, by everybody. Well, by the media, by our allies., By the World Bank-, By everyone, has discredited. And matter of fact [crosstalk 00:23:30] Matter of fact-, Even the people who testified under oath-, Even the people under-, … testified under oath in his administration said I did my job and I did it very well., I did it honorably., Well, I’ll give you the list of the people who-, I’m sure that you’ve already fired most of them, because they did a good job., Well, here’s the- [crosstalk 00:23:57], Well, it’s hard to get any word in with this clown. Excuse me, this person., No, no. Mr. President- [crosstalk 00:24:05], That is simply not true., Look, here’s the deal. We want to talk about families and ethics. I don’t want to do that. I mean, his family, we could talk about all night. His family’s already-, And that’s such a- [crosstalk 00:24:25], This is not about my family or his family. It’s about your family, the American people. [crosstalk 00:24:32] That’s not true. It doesn’t want to talk about what you need. You, the American people, it’s about you. That’s what we’re talking about here. [crosstalk 00:24:42], He didn’t take that., Try to be honest., That is absolutely not true., That’s a good point., It’s about equity and equality. It’s about decency. It’s about the constitution. And we have never walked away from trying to require equity for everyone, equality for the whole of America. But we’ve never accomplished it, but we’ve never walked away from it like he has done. It is true, the reason I got in the race is when those people… Close your eyes, remember what those people look like coming out of the fields, carrying torches, their veins bulging, just spewing anti-Semitic bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. A young woman got killed and they asked the president what he thought. He said, “There were very fine people on both sides.” No president’s ever said anything like that. [crosstalk 00:27:10]., Now-, … second point I’d make to you, is that when Floyd was killed, when Mr. Floyd was killed, there was a peaceful protest in front of the White House. What did he do? He came out of his bunker, had the military use tear gas on them so he could walk across to a church and hold up a Bible. And then what happened after that? The Bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace. The general who was with him said all he ever wants to do is divide people, not unite people at all. This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle, to try to generate racists hatred, racist division., This is a man who, in fact, you talk about helping African-Americans, one in 1000 African Americans has been killed because of the coronavirus. And if he doesn’t do something quickly, by the end of the year, one in 500 will have been killed. One in 500 African Americans. This man is as a savior of African-Americans? This man cares at all? This man’s done virtually nothing. Look, the fact is that you have to look at what he talks about. You have to look at what he did. And what he did has been disastrous for the African-American community., I’ve never said-, Yes, there is. There’s systemic injustice in this country, in education and work and in law enforcement and the way in which it’s enforced. But look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable men and women. They risk their lives every day to take care of us, but there are some bad apples. And when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out. They have to be held accountable. They have to be held accountable. And what I’m going to do as President of the United States is call together an entire group of people at the White House, everything from the civil rights groups, to the police officers, to the police chiefs, and we’re going to work this out., We’re going to work this out. So we changed the way in which we have more transparency, in when these things happen. These cops aren’t happy to see what happened to George Floyd. These cops aren’t happy to see what happened to Breonna Taylor. Most don’t like it, but we have to have a system where people are held accountable when… And by the way, violence in response is never appropriate, never appropriate. Peaceful protest is, violence is never appropriate., That is not peaceful protest., Nobody’s doing that. He’s the racist., Here’s the deal. I know a lot more about this- [crosstalk 00:15:43]., The fact is that there is racial insensitivity. People have to be made aware of what other people feel like, what insults them, what is demeaning to them. It’s important people know. Many people don’t want to hurt other people’s feelings, but it makes a big difference. It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a sense of self-esteem. It’s a little bit like how this guy and his friends look down on so many people. They look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics, like me, who grow up in Scranton. They look down on people who don’t have money. They look down on people who are of a different faith. They looked down on people who are a different color. In fact, we’re all Americans. The only way we’re going to bring this country together is bring everybody together. There’s nothing we cannot do, if we do it together. We can take this on and we can defeat racism in American., Oh my Lord., This is ridiculous., Absolutely ridiculous., Violent crime-, I’m in favor of law. You- [crosstalk 00:35:15]., Law and order with justice, where people get treated fairly., And the fact of the matter is, violent crime went down 17%, 15% in our administration. It’s gone up on his watch., He wouldn’t know a suburb unless you took a wrong turn., I was raised in the suburbs. This is not 1950. All these dog whistles and racism don’t work anymore. Suburbs are by and large integrated. There’s many people today driving their kids to soccer practice and/or black and white and Hispanic in the same car as there have been any time in the past, what really is a threat to the suburbs and their safety is his failure to deal with COVID. They’re dying in the suburbs. His failure to deal with the environment, they’re being flooded, they’re being burned out because his refusal to do anything. That’s why the suburbs are in trouble., Look, what I support are the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face and I’m totally opposed to defunding the police offices. As a matter of fact police, local police, the only one defunding in his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance. They need more assistance. They need when they show up for a 9-11 call to have someone with them as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down. We have to have community policing like we had before where the officers get to know the people in the communities. That’s when crime went down, it didn’t go up. It went down. And so we have to be…, That is not true., That’s not true., We don’t have time to do anything., I don’t hold public office. Now I am a former vice president. I’ve made it clear. I’ve made it clear in my public statements that the violence should be prosecuted. It should be prosecuted and anyone who committed it should be prosecuted., They can in fact take care of it if he just stay out of the way., And by the way his own former spokesperson said, “Riots and chaos and violence help he cause.” That’s what this is all about., I do., I think Kellyanne Conway., She said that., Here’s the point, the point is that that’s why he keeps trying to rile everything up. He doesn’t want to calm things down instead of going in and talking to people and saying, “Let’s get everybody together. Figure out how to deal with this.” What’s he do? He just pours gasoline in the fire constantly and every single solitary time., Say it, do it say it., He’s own FBI Director said unlike white supremacist, Antifa is an idea not an organization-, … not a militia. That’s what his FBI Director said., Every body in your administration tells you the true, it’s a bad idea. You have no idea about anything., Under this president, we become weaker, sicker, poor, more divided and more violent. When I was vice president, we inherited a recession. I was asked to fix it. I did. We left him a booming economy and he caused the recession. With regard to being weaker, the fact is that I’ve gone head to head with Putin and made it clear to him we’re not going to take any of his stuff. He’s Putin’s puppy. He still refuses to even say anything to Putin about the bounty on the heads of American soldiers., By the way, my son…, He never keeps his word., Can you get back 30 seconds?, So thirdly, we’re poor. The billionaires have gotten much more wealthy by a tune of over $3- $400 billion more just since COVID. You in the home, you got less you’re in more trouble than you were before. In terms of being more violent. When we were in office there were 15% less violence in America than there is today. He’s President United States. It’s on his watch. And with regard to more divided the nation, it can’t stay divided. We can’t be this way. And speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military, the way you talk about them being losers and being and just being suckers. My son was in Iraq. He spent a year there. He got the Brown Star. He got the Conspicuous Service Medal. He was not a loser. He was a Patriot and the people left behind there were heroes., And I resent-, I’m talking about my son, Beau Biden, you’re talking about Hunter?, That’s not true he was not dishonorably discharged., None of that is true., That is not true., My son like a lot of people at home had a drug problem. He’s overtaking it. He’s fixed it. He’s worked on it. And I’m proud of him, I’m proud of my son., He wasn’t given tens of millions of dollars. [crosstalk 00:48:23] It was all discredited., That is not true. That report is totally discredited., Mitt Romney on that committee said it wasn’t worth taxpayer’s money. That report was written for political reason., So would I., Why have you relaxed fuel economy standards that are going to create more pollution from cars and trucks?, He’s absolutely wrong, number one. Number two, if in fact, during our administration in the recovery act, I was in charge able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than are as cheap as coal and gas and oil. Nobody’s going to build another coal fired plant in America. No one’s going to build another oil fire plant in America. They’re going to move to renewable energy. Number one, number two, we’re going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet that’s run on their electric vehicles. Making sure that we can do that, we’re going to put 500,000 charging stations in all of the highways that we’re going to be building in the future. We’re going to build a economy that in fact is going to provide for the ability of us to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they in fact are weatherized in a way that in fact will they’ll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There’s so many things that we can do…, Gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There’s so many things that we can do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs. We can get to net zero, in terms of energy production, by 2035. Not only not costing people jobs, creating jobs, creating millions of good-paying jobs. Not 15 bucks an hour, but prevailing wage, by having a new infrastructure that in fact, is green. And the first thing I will do, I will rejoin the Paris Accord. I will join the Paris Accord because with us out of it, look what’s happening. It’s all falling apart. And talk about someone who has no relationship with foreign policy. The rainforests of Brazil are being torn down, are being ripped down. More carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that’s emitted in the United States. Instead of doing something about that, I would be gathering up and making sure we had the countries of the world coming up with $20 billion, and say, “Here’s $20 billion. Stop tearing down the forest. And If you don’t, then you’re going to have significant economic consequences.”, Well, he hasn’t drawn a line. He wants to make sure that methane’s not a problem. You can now emit more methane without it being a problem. Methane. This is a guy who says that you don’t have to have mileage standards for automobiles that exist now. This is the guy who says that, the fact that-, It’s all true. And here’s the deal-, I’m talking about the Biden plan [crosstalk 00:55:51]-, No., That is not-, Not true-, Not true., Not true., Simply… Look-, That is simply not the case-, What it’s going to do, it’s going to create thousands and millions of jobs. Good paying jobs [crosstalk 00:02:41]., He doesn’t know how to do that-, The fact is, it’s going to create millions of good paying jobs, and these tax incentives for people to weatherize, which he wants to get rid of. It’s going to make the economy much safer. Look how much we’re paying now to deal with the hurricanes, deal with… By the way, he has an answer for hurricanes. He said, maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them, and they may-, Yeah, he did say that-, And here’s the deal-, … we’re going to be in a position where we can create hard, hard, good jobs by making sure the environment is clean, and we all are in better shape. We spend billions of dollars now, billions of dollars, on floods, hurricanes, rising seas. We’re in real trouble. Look what’s happened just in the Midwest with these storms that come through and wipe out entire sections and counties in Iowa. They didn’t happen before. They’re because of global warming. We make up 15% of the world’s problem. But the rest of the world, we’ve got to get them to come along. That’s why we have to get back into the Paris Accord., For 47-, That is not my plan [crosstalk 00:58:10]. The Green New Deal [crosstalk 00:58:14] is not my plan. [crosstalk 00:58:15]-, I did not say that-, Play it. Play it-, The final question is, I can’t remember which of all his rantings [crosstalk 00:04:44]., Yeah., The economy-, The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward. We’re not going to build plants that, in fact, are great polluting plants-, Pardon me?, No, I don’t support the Green New Deal., I support [crosstalk 00:05:13]-, I support [crosstalk 00:59:17] the Biden plan that I put forward., The Biden plan, which is different than what he calls the radical Green New Deal., Prepare to let people vote. They should go to iwillvote.com, decide how they’re going to vote, when they’re going to vote, and what means by which they’re going to vote. His own Homeland Security director, and as well as the FBI director, says that there is no evidence at all that mail-in ballots are a source of being manipulated and cheating. They said that. The fact is that there are going to be millions of people because of COVID that are going to be voting by mail-in ballots like he does, by the way. He sits behind the Resolute Desk and sends his ballot to Florida, number one. Number two, we’re going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because there are enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance. The polls are open on time, and the polls stay open until the votes are counted. And this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he’s trying to scare people into thinking that it’s not going to be legitimate., Show up and vote. You will determine the outcome of this election. Vote, vote, vote. If you’re able to vote early in your state, vote early. If you’re able to vote in person, vote in person. Vote whatever way is the best way for you, because you will… He cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election. And in terms of whether or not… When the votes are counted and they’re all counted, that will be accepted. If I win, that will be accepted. If I lose, that’ll be accepted. But by the way, if in fact he says, he’s not sure what he’s going to accept. Well, let me tell you something, it doesn’t matter, because if we get the votes, it’s going to be all over. He’s going to go. He can’t stay in power. It won’t happen. It won’t happen, so vote. Just make sure you understand, you have it in your control to determine what this country is going to look like the next four years. Is it going to change, or are you going to get four more years of these lies?, There is no [crosstalk 01:05:32]… There is no evidence of that-, There is no evidence of that-, Five states have had mail-in ballots for the last decade or more. Five, including two Republican states. And you don’t have to solicit the ballot. It’s sent to you. It’s sent to your home. What they’re saying is that it has to be a postmark by election day. If it doesn’t get in until the seventh, eighth, ninth, it still should be counted. He’s just afraid of counting the votes-, I am concerned that any court would settle this, because here’s the deal. When you get a ballot and you fill it out, you’re supposed to have an affidavit. If you didn’t know, you have someone say that, this is me. You should be able to, if in fact you can verify that’s you before the ballot is thrown out, that’s sufficient to be able to count the ballot because someone made a mistake and not dotting the correct I. Who they voted for, testify, say who they voted for, say it’s you. That is totally legitimate., Mail service delivers [crosstalk 01:07:21] 185 million pieces of mail a day [crosstalk 01:07:24]-, Yes. And here’s the deal. We count the ballots, as you pointed out. Some of these ballots in some states can’t even be opened until election day. And if there’s thousands of ballots, it’s going to take time to do it. And by the way, our military… They’ve been voting by ballots since the end of the Civil War, in effect. And that’s what’s going to happen. Why is it, for them, somehow not fraudulent. It’s the same process. It’s honest. No one has established at all that there is fraud related to mail-in ballots, that somehow it’s a fraudulent process., He has no idea what he’s talking about. Here’s the deal. The fact is, I will accept it, and he will too. You know why? Because once the winner is declared after all the ballots are counted, all the votes are counted, that’ll be the end of it. That’ll be the end of it. And if it’s me, in fact, fine. If it’s not me, I’ll support the outcome. And I’ll be a president, not just for the Democrats. I’ll be a president for Democrats and Republicans.

man i m well well first of all thank you for doing this and looking forward to this mr president the american people have a right to have a say in who the supreme court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for united states senators and when they vote for the president of united states they re not going to get that chance now because we re in the middle of an election already the election has already started tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait we should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that s the only way the american people get to express their view is by who they elect as president and who they elect as vice president now what s at stake here is the president s made it clear he wants to get rid of the affordable care act he s been running on that he ran on that and he s been governing on that he s in the supreme court right now trying to get rid of the affordable care act which will strip million people from having health insurance now if it goes into court and the justice i m not opposed to the justice she seems like a very fine person but she s written before she went in the bench which is her right that she thinks that the affordable care act is not constitutional the other thing that s on the court and if it s struck down what happens women s rights are fundamentally changed once again a woman could pay more money because she has a pre existing condition of pregnancy they re able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets and that ended when we in fact passed the affordable care act and there s a hundred million people who have pre existing conditions and they ll be taken away as well those pre existing conditions insurance companies are going to love this and so it s just not appropriate to do this before this election if he wins the election and the senate is republican then he goes forward if not we should wait until february he s elected to the next election that s simply not true open discussion number one he knows what i proposed what i proposed is that we expand obamacare and we increase it we do not wipe any and one of the big debates we had with of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that i won were saying that biden wanted to allow people to have private insurance still they can they do they will under my proposal that is simply a lie the party is me right now i am the democratic party i am the democratic party right now the platform of the democratic party is what i in fact approved of what i approved of now here s the deal the deal is that it s going to wipe out pre existing conditions and by the way the people that have died on his watch how many of those have survived well there s seven million people that contracted covid what does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the affordable care act i m happy to talk about this you re not going to be able to shut him up let me finish the point is that the president also is opposed to roe v wade that s on the ballot as well and the court in the court and so that s also at stake right now and so the election is all it s on the ballot in the court in the court donald would you just be quiet for a minute all right good healthcare he has not done healthcare yes it is not it does not it s only for those people who are so poor they qualify for medicaid they can get that free in most states except governors who want to deny people who are poor medicaid anyone who qualifies for medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option the vast majority of the american people would still not be in that option number one number two look hey i m not going to listen to him the fact of the matter is i beat bernie sanders i beat him by a whole hell of a lot i m here standing facing you old buddy all he knows how to do look he s the deal i got very lucky i m going to get very lucky tonight as well and tonight i m going to make sure because here s the deal here s the deal the fact is that everything he s saying so far is simply a lie i m not here to call out his lies everybody knows he s a liar god i want to make sure no he doesn t know how to do that the wrong guy the wrong night at the wrong time there is no manifesto number one number two number two i ll tell you what he is not for any help for people needing healthcare because he in fact already has costs million people their healthcare that they had from their employers because of his recession number one number two there are million people getting healthcare through obamacare now that he wants to take it away he won t ever look you in the eye and say that s what he wants to do take it away he doesn t know how he doesn t know how to do that he has never offered a plan he has no plan for healthcare he sends out wishful thinking he has executive orders that have no power he hasn t lowered drug costs for anybody he s been promising a healthcare plan since he got elected he has none like almost everything else he talks about he does not have a plan he doesn t have a plan and the fact is this man doesn t know what he s talking about crosstalk sure whatever position i take on that that ll become the issue the issue is the american people should speak you should go out and vote you re voting now vote and let your senators know strongly how you feel vote now make sure you in fact let people know your senators i m not going to answer the question will you shut up man this is so un presidential that was really a productive segment wasn t it keep yapping man they sure do good luck dead as you said over seven million infected in the united states we in fact have of the world s population of the deaths people a day are contracting covid in addition to that about between and people a day are dying when he was presented with that number he said it is what it is well it is what it is because you are who you are that s why it is the president has no plan he hasn t laid out anything he knew all the way back in february how serious this crisis was he knew it was a deadly disease what did he do he s on tape as acknowledging he knew it he said he didn t tell us or give people a warning of it because he didn t want to panic the american people you don t panic he panicked in addition to that what did he do he went in and we were insisting that the people we had in the ground in china should be able to go to wuhan and determine for themselves how dangerous this was he did not even ask xi to do that he told us what a great job xi was doing he said we owe him debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us and what did he do then he then did nothing he waited and waited and waited he still doesn t have a plan i laid out back in march exactly what we should be doing and i laid out again in july what we should be doing we should be providing all the protective gear possible we should be providing the money the house has passed in order to be able to go out and get people the help they need to keep their businesses open open schools cost a lot of money you should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap in your golf course and go in the oval office and bring together the democrats and republicans and fund what needs to be done now to save lives i know how to do the job i know how to get the job done people died not and there was no one we didn t shut down the economy this is his economy he shut down the reason it s shut down is because look you folks at home how many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died of covid how many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn t even speak to them you had a nurse holding a phone up so you could in fact say goodbye his own cdc director says we could lose as many as another people between now and the end of the year and he said if we just wear a mask we can save half those numbers just a mask and by the way in terms of the whole notion of a vaccine we re for a vaccine but i don t trust him at all nor do you i know you don t what we trust is a scientist god this is the same man who told you by easter this would be gone away by the warm weather it d be gone miraculous like a miracle and by the way maybe you could inject some bleach in your arm and that would take care of it this is the same man so here s the deal this man is talking about a vaccine every serious company is talking about maybe having a vaccine done by the end of the year but the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning of the middle of next year to get it out if we get the vaccine and pray god we will pray god we will no more than the question you just asked him you pointed out he puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientists everybody knows well no no you can trust the scientist she didn t say that you can trust the yes well that s what he s going to try to do but there s thousands of scientists out there like here at this great hospital that don t work for him their job doesn t depend on him they re the people and by the way by the way do you believe for a moment what he s telling you in light of all the lies he s told you about the whole issue relating to covid he still hasn t even acknowledged that he knew this was happening knew how dangerous it was going to be back in february and he didn t even tell you he s on record as saying it he panicked or he just looked at the stock market one of the two because guess what a lot of people died and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter a lot quicker oh give me a break well let s have this debate because he doesn t have a plan if i were running it i d know what the plan is you ve got to provide these businesses the ability to have the money to be able to reopen with the ppe as well as with the sanitation they need you have to provide them classic will he just shush for a minute nancy pelosi and schumer they have a plan he won t even meet with them the republicans won t meet in the senate he sits in his golf course well i mean literally think about it think about it you just admitted you d shut it down i got to respond to that i got to respond to that just like your rally look the way to open businesses is give them the wherewithal to be able open we provided money the well masks make a big difference his own head of the cdc said if we just wore masks between now if everybody wore a mask and social distanced between now and january we d probably save up to lives it matters it matters no serious person has said the opposite no serious person he did not say the opposite by the way did you see one of the last big rallies he had a reporter came up to him to ask him a question he said no no no stand back put on your mask put on a mask have you been tested i m way far away from those other people that s what he said i m going to be okay he s not worried about you he s not worried about the people out there crosstalk no negative effect come on yes i would he s been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing and people wearing masks basically encouraged them not to he s a fool on this the difference is millionaires and billionaires like him in the middle of the covid crisis have done very well billionaires have made another billion because of his profligate tax proposal and he only focused on the market but you folks at home you folks living in scranton and claymont and all the small towns and working class towns in america how well are you doing this guy paid a total of in taxes do i get my time back the fact is that he has in fact worked on this in a way that he s going to be the first president of the united states to leave office having fewer jobs in his administration than when he became president fewer jobs than when he became president first one in american history secondly the people who have lost their jobs are those people who have been on the front lines those people who have been saving our lives those people who have been out there dying people who ve been putting themselves in the way to make sure that we could all try to make it and the idea that he is insisting that we go forward and open when you have almost half the states in america with a significant increase in covid deaths and covid cases in the united states of america and he wants to open it up more why is he want to open it up why does he take care of the you can t fix the economy until you fix the covid crisis and he has no intention of doing anything about making it better for you all at home in terms of your health and your safety schools why aren t schools open because it costs a lot of money to open them safely they were going to give his administration going to give the teachers and school students masks and then they decided no couldn t do that because it s not a national emergency not a national emergency they ve done nothing to help small businesses nothing they re closing one in six is now gone he ought to get on the job and take care of the needs of the american people so we can open safely people want to be safe people want to be safe show us your tax returns show us your tax returns release your tax return when in crosstalk yeah i do want to respond look the tax code that put him in a position that he pays less tax than on the money a school teacher makes is because of him he says he s smart because he can take advantage of the tax code and he does take advantage of the tax code that s why i m going to eliminate the trump tax cuts and i m going to eliminate those tax cuts and make sure that we invest in the people who in fact need the help people out there need help because you weren t president because you weren t president and screwing things up you re the worst president america has ever had come on well just take a look at what is the analysis done by wall street firms points out that my economic plan would create million more jobs than his in four years number one and number two it would create an additional trillion in economic growth because it would be about buying american the federal government spends billion a year on everything from ships to steel to buildings and the like and under my proposal we re going to make sure that every penny of that has to be made by a company by the way i m going to eliminate a significant number of the taxes i m going to make the corporate tax it shouldn t be you have companies federal i mean the fortune who don t pay a single penny in tax making billions of dollars because you in fact passed that that was your tax proposal yeah you got it done the economy let me finish not lower tax for the american people look we inherited the worst recession short of a depression in american history i was asked to bring it back we were able to have an economic recovery that created the jobs you re talking about we handed him a booming economy he blew it he blew it yeah because what he did even before covid manufacturing went in the hole manufacturing went in a hole number one number two number three no this guy we did not crosstalk i m the guy that brought back the automobile industry i was asked to bring back chrysler and general motors he brought them back right here in the state of ohio and michigan he blew it they re gone he blew it and in fact they re gone that is not true and so you take a look at what he s actually done he s done very little his trade deals are the same way he talks about these great trade deals he talks about the art of the deal china s perfected the art of the steel we have a higher deficit with china now than we did before we have the highest trade deficit with mexico that is not true none of that is true none of that is true is totally totally discredited totally discredited and by the way mr vice that is not true it is not a fact it s been totally discredited my son did nothing wrong at barisma he doesn t want to let me answer because he knows i have the truth his position has been totally thoroughly discredited and you can by everybody well by the media by our allies by the world bank by everyone has discredited and matter of fact crosstalk matter of fact even the people who testified under oath even the people under testified under oath in his administration said i did my job and i did it very well i did it honorably well i ll give you the list of the people who i m sure that you ve already fired most of them because they did a good job well here s the crosstalk well it s hard to get any word in with this clown excuse me this person no no mr president crosstalk that is simply not true look here s the deal we want to talk about families and ethics i don t want to do that i mean his family we could talk about all night his family s already and that s such a crosstalk this is not about my family or his family it s about your family the american people crosstalk that s not true it doesn t want to talk about what you need you the american people it s about you that s what we re talking about here crosstalk he didn t take that try to be honest that is absolutely not true that s a good point it s about equity and equality it s about decency it s about the constitution and we have never walked away from trying to require equity for everyone equality for the whole of america but we ve never accomplished it but we ve never walked away from it like he has done it is true the reason i got in the race is when those people close your eyes remember what those people look like coming out of the fields carrying torches their veins bulging just spewing anti semitic bile and accompanied by the ku klux klan a young woman got killed and they asked the president what he thought he said there were very fine people on both sides no president s ever said anything like that crosstalk now second point i d make to you is that when floyd was killed when mr floyd was killed there was a peaceful protest in front of the white house what did he do he came out of his bunker had the military use tear gas on them so he could walk across to a church and hold up a bible and then what happened after that the bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace the general who was with him said all he ever wants to do is divide people not unite people at all this is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle to try to generate racists hatred racist division this is a man who in fact you talk about helping african americans one in african americans has been killed because of the coronavirus and if he doesn t do something quickly by the end of the year one in will have been killed one in african americans this man is as a savior of african americans this man cares at all this man s done virtually nothing look the fact is that you have to look at what he talks about you have to look at what he did and what he did has been disastrous for the african american community i ve never said yes there is there s systemic injustice in this country in education and work and in law enforcement and the way in which it s enforced but look the vast majority of police officers are good decent honorable men and women they risk their lives every day to take care of us but there are some bad apples and when they occur when they find them they have to be sorted out they have to be held accountable they have to be held accountable and what i m going to do as president of the united states is call together an entire group of people at the white house everything from the civil rights groups to the police officers to the police chiefs and we re going to work this out we re going to work this out so we changed the way in which we have more transparency in when these things happen these cops aren t happy to see what happened to george floyd these cops aren t happy to see what happened to breonna taylor most don t like it but we have to have a system where people are held accountable when and by the way violence in response is never appropriate never appropriate peaceful protest is violence is never appropriate that is not peaceful protest nobody s doing that he s the racist here s the deal i know a lot more about this crosstalk the fact is that there is racial insensitivity people have to be made aware of what other people feel like what insults them what is demeaning to them it s important people know many people don t want to hurt other people s feelings but it makes a big difference it makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a sense of self esteem it s a little bit like how this guy and his friends look down on so many people they look down their nose on people like irish catholics like me who grow up in scranton they look down on people who don t have money they look down on people who are of a different faith they looked down on people who are a different color in fact we re all americans the only way we re going to bring this country together is bring everybody together there s nothing we cannot do if we do it together we can take this on and we can defeat racism in american oh my lord this is ridiculous absolutely ridiculous violent crime i m in favor of law you crosstalk law and order with justice where people get treated fairly and the fact of the matter is violent crime went down in our administration it s gone up on his watch he wouldn t know a suburb unless you took a wrong turn i was raised in the suburbs this is not all these dog whistles and racism don t work anymore suburbs are by and large integrated there s many people today driving their kids to soccer practice and or black and white and hispanic in the same car as there have been any time in the past what really is a threat to the suburbs and their safety is his failure to deal with covid they re dying in the suburbs his failure to deal with the environment they re being flooded they re being burned out because his refusal to do anything that s why the suburbs are in trouble look what i support are the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face and i m totally opposed to defunding the police offices as a matter of fact police local police the only one defunding in his budget calls for a million cut in local law enforcement assistance they need more assistance they need when they show up for a call to have someone with them as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down we have to have community policing like we had before where the officers get to know the people in the communities that s when crime went down it didn t go up it went down and so we have to be that is not true that s not true we don t have time to do anything i don t hold public office now i am a former vice president i ve made it clear i ve made it clear in my public statements that the violence should be prosecuted it should be prosecuted and anyone who committed it should be prosecuted they can in fact take care of it if he just stay out of the way and by the way his own former spokesperson said riots and chaos and violence help he cause that s what this is all about i do i think kellyanne conway she said that here s the point the point is that that s why he keeps trying to rile everything up he doesn t want to calm things down instead of going in and talking to people and saying let s get everybody together figure out how to deal with this what s he do he just pours gasoline in the fire constantly and every single solitary time say it do it say it he s own fbi director said unlike white supremacist antifa is an idea not an organization not a militia that s what his fbi director said every body in your administration tells you the true it s a bad idea you have no idea about anything under this president we become weaker sicker poor more divided and more violent when i was vice president we inherited a recession i was asked to fix it i did we left him a booming economy and he caused the recession with regard to being weaker the fact is that i ve gone head to head with putin and made it clear to him we re not going to take any of his stuff he s putin s puppy he still refuses to even say anything to putin about the bounty on the heads of american soldiers by the way my son he never keeps his word can you get back seconds so thirdly we re poor the billionaires have gotten much more wealthy by a tune of over billion more just since covid you in the home you got less you re in more trouble than you were before in terms of being more violent when we were in office there were less violence in america than there is today he s president united states it s on his watch and with regard to more divided the nation it can t stay divided we can t be this way and speaking of my son the way you talk about the military the way you talk about them being losers and being and just being suckers my son was in iraq he spent a year there he got the brown star he got the conspicuous service medal he was not a loser he was a patriot and the people left behind there were heroes and i resent i m talking about my son beau biden you re talking about hunter that s not true he was not dishonorably discharged none of that is true that is not true my son like a lot of people at home had a drug problem he s overtaking it he s fixed it he s worked on it and i m proud of him i m proud of my son he wasn t given tens of millions of dollars crosstalk it was all discredited that is not true that report is totally discredited mitt romney on that committee said it wasn t worth taxpayer s money that report was written for political reason so would i why have you relaxed fuel economy standards that are going to create more pollution from cars and trucks he s absolutely wrong number one number two if in fact during our administration in the recovery act i was in charge able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than are as cheap as coal and gas and oil nobody s going to build another coal fired plant in america no one s going to build another oil fire plant in america they re going to move to renewable energy number one number two we re going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet that s run on their electric vehicles making sure that we can do that we re going to put charging stations in all of the highways that we re going to be building in the future we re going to build a economy that in fact is going to provide for the ability of us to take million buildings and make sure that they in fact are weatherized in a way that in fact will they ll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out there s so many things that we can do gas and oil because the heat will not be going out there s so many things that we can do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs we can get to net zero in terms of energy production by not only not costing people jobs creating jobs creating millions of good paying jobs not bucks an hour but prevailing wage by having a new infrastructure that in fact is green and the first thing i will do i will rejoin the paris accord i will join the paris accord because with us out of it look what s happening it s all falling apart and talk about someone who has no relationship with foreign policy the rainforests of brazil are being torn down are being ripped down more carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that s emitted in the united states instead of doing something about that i would be gathering up and making sure we had the countries of the world coming up with billion and say here s billion stop tearing down the forest and if you don t then you re going to have significant economic consequences well he hasn t drawn a line he wants to make sure that methane s not a problem you can now emit more methane without it being a problem methane this is a guy who says that you don t have to have mileage standards for automobiles that exist now this is the guy who says that the fact that it s all true and here s the deal i m talking about the biden plan crosstalk no that is not not true not true not true simply look that is simply not the case what it s going to do it s going to create thousands and millions of jobs good paying jobs crosstalk he doesn t know how to do that the fact is it s going to create millions of good paying jobs and these tax incentives for people to weatherize which he wants to get rid of it s going to make the economy much safer look how much we re paying now to deal with the hurricanes deal with by the way he has an answer for hurricanes he said maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them and they may yeah he did say that and here s the deal we re going to be in a position where we can create hard hard good jobs by making sure the environment is clean and we all are in better shape we spend billions of dollars now billions of dollars on floods hurricanes rising seas we re in real trouble look what s happened just in the midwest with these storms that come through and wipe out entire sections and counties in iowa they didn t happen before they re because of global warming we make up of the world s problem but the rest of the world we ve got to get them to come along that s why we have to get back into the paris accord for that is not my plan crosstalk the green new deal crosstalk is not my plan crosstalk i did not say that play it play it the final question is i can t remember which of all his rantings crosstalk yeah the economy the green new deal will pay for itself as we move forward we re not going to build plants that in fact are great polluting plants pardon me no i don t support the green new deal i support crosstalk i support crosstalk the biden plan that i put forward the biden plan which is different than what he calls the radical green new deal prepare to let people vote they should go to iwillvote com decide how they re going to vote when they re going to vote and what means by which they re going to vote his own homeland security director and as well as the fbi director says that there is no evidence at all that mail in ballots are a source of being manipulated and cheating they said that the fact is that there are going to be millions of people because of covid that are going to be voting by mail in ballots like he does by the way he sits behind the resolute desk and sends his ballot to florida number one number two we re going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because there are enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance the polls are open on time and the polls stay open until the votes are counted and this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he s trying to scare people into thinking that it s not going to be legitimate show up and vote you will determine the outcome of this election vote vote vote if you re able to vote early in your state vote early if you re able to vote in person vote in person vote whatever way is the best way for you because you will he cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election and in terms of whether or not when the votes are counted and they re all counted that will be accepted if i win that will be accepted if i lose that ll be accepted but by the way if in fact he says he s not sure what he s going to accept well let me tell you something it doesn t matter because if we get the votes it s going to be all over he s going to go he can t stay in power it won t happen it won t happen so vote just make sure you understand you have it in your control to determine what this country is going to look like the next four years is it going to change or are you going to get four more years of these lies there is no crosstalk there is no evidence of that there is no evidence of that five states have had mail in ballots for the last decade or more five including two republican states and you don t have to solicit the ballot it s sent to you it s sent to your home what they re saying is that it has to be a postmark by election day if it doesn t get in until the seventh eighth ninth it still should be counted he s just afraid of counting the votes i am concerned that any court would settle this because here s the deal when you get a ballot and you fill it out you re supposed to have an affidavit if you didn t know you have someone say that this is me you should be able to if in fact you can verify that s you before the ballot is thrown out that s sufficient to be able to count the ballot because someone made a mistake and not dotting the correct i who they voted for testify say who they voted for say it s you that is totally legitimate mail service delivers crosstalk million pieces of mail a day crosstalk yes and here s the deal we count the ballots as you pointed out some of these ballots in some states can t even be opened until election day and if there s thousands of ballots it s going to take time to do it and by the way our military they ve been voting by ballots since the end of the civil war in effect and that s what s going to happen why is it for them somehow not fraudulent it s the same process it s honest no one has established at all that there is fraud related to mail in ballots that somehow it s a fraudulent process he has no idea what he s talking about here s the deal the fact is i will accept it and he will too you know why because once the winner is declared after all the ballots are counted all the votes are counted that ll be the end of it that ll be the end of it and if it s me in fact fine if it s not me i ll support the outcome and i ll be a president not just for the democrats i ll be a president for democrats and republicans and this guy

are you doing? How are you?, So as you know, 2.2 million people modeled out, were expected to die. We closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from China. It’s a worldwide pandemic. It’s all over the world. You see the spikes in Europe and many other places right now. If you notice, the mortality rate is down 85%. The excess mortality rate is way down and much lower than almost any other country. And we’re fighting it and we’re fighting it hard. There is a spike. There was a spike in Florida and it’s now gone., There was a very big spike in Texas. It’s now gone. There was a very big spike in Arizona. It’s now gone. And there was some spikes and surges and other places, they will soon be gone. We have a vaccine that’s coming. It’s ready. It’s going to be announced within weeks. And it’s going to be delivered. We have Operation Warp Speed, which is the military is going to distribute the vaccine., I can tell you from personal experience, I was in the hospital. I had it and I got better. And I will tell you that I had something that they gave me, a therapeutic, I guess they would call it. Some people could say it was a cure, but I was in for a short period of time. And I got better very fast or I wouldn’t be here tonight. And now they say I’m immune. Whether it’s four months or a lifetime, nobody’s been able to say that, but I’m immune. More and more people are getting better. We have a problem that’s a worldwide problem. This is a worldwide problem, but I’ve been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we’ve been able to do. If you take a look at what we’ve done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else, and in particular ventilators we’re now making ventilators all over the world, thousands and thousands a month distributing them all over the world. It will go away. And as I say, we’re rounding the turn. We’re rounding the corner. It’s going away., No, it’s not a guarantee, but it will be by the end of the year. But I think it has a good chance. There are two companies, I think within a matter of weeks and it will be distributed very quickly., Johnson & Johnson is doing very well. Moderna is doing very well. Pfizer is doing very well and we have numerous others. Then we also have others that we’re working on very closely with other countries, in particular Europe., No, I think my timeline is going to be more accurate. I don’t know that they’re counting on the military the way I do, but we have our generals lined up, one in particular that’s the head of logistics and this is a very easy distribution for him. He’s ready to go. As soon as we have the vaccine and we expect to have a 100 million vials. As soon as we have the vaccine, he’s ready to go., I don’t think we’re going to have a dark winter at all. We’re opening up our country. We’ve learned and studied and understand the disease, which we didn’t at the beginning. When I closed and banned China from coming in heavily infected and then ultimately Europe, but China was in January. Months later, he was saying I was xenophobic. I did it too soon. Now he’s saying, “Oh, I should have moved quicker,” but he didn’t move quicker. He was months behind me, many months behind me., And frankly, he ran the H1N1 swine flu and it was a total disaster. Far less lethal, but it was a total disaster. Had that had this kind of numbers, 700,000 people would be dead right now, but it was a far less lethal disease. Look, his own person who ran that for him, who, as you know, was his chief of staff said, “It was catastrophic. It was horrible. We didn’t know what we were doing.” Now he comes up and he tells us how to do this., Also, everything that he said about the way every single move that he said we should make, that’s what we’ve done. We’ve done all of it. But he was way behind us., 99% of people recover. We have to recover. We can’t close up our nation. We have to open our school and we can’t close up our nation, or you’re not going to have a nation., Excuse me. I take full responsibility. It’s not my fault that it came here. It’s China’s fault. And you know what? It’s not Joe’s fault that it came here either. It’s China’s fault. They kept it from going into the rest of China for the most part, but they didn’t keep it from coming out to the world, including Europe and ourselves., Look, perhaps just to finish this, I was kidding on that, but just to finish this, when I closed he said I shouldn’t have closed. And that went on for months. Nancy Pelosi said the same thing. She was dancing on the streets in Chinatown, in San Francisco. But when I closed, he said, “This is a terrible thing, you xenophobic.” I think he called me racist even, because I was closing it to China. Now he says I should have closed it earlier. Joe, it doesn’t., You certainly did. You certainly did., He thought I shouldn’t have closed the border, that’s obvious., I think we have to respond, if I might., Thank you, and I appreciate that. Look, all he does is talk about shut downs. But forget about him. His Democrat Governors, Cuomo in New York, you look at what’s going on in California, you look at Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Democrats, Democrats all, they’re shut down so tight and they’re dying. They’re dying. And he supports all these people. All he talks about is shut downs. No, we’re not going to shut down. And we have to open our schools. And it’s like, as an example, I have a young son, he also tested positive. By the time I spoke to the doctor the second time, he was fine. It just went away. Young people, I guess, it’s their immune system., I want to open the schools. The transmittal rate to the teachers is very small. But I want to open the schools. We have to open our country. We’re not going to have a country. You can’t do this. We can’t keep this country closed. This is a massive country with a massive economy. People are losing their jobs. They’re committing suicide. There’s depression, alcohol, drugs at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. There’s abuse, tremendous abuse. We have to open our country. I’ve said it often, the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, and that’s what’s happening. And he wants to close down. He’ll close down the country if one person in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down., By the way, I will say this, If you go and look at what’s happened to New York, it’s a ghost town. It’s a ghost town. And when you talk about plexiglass, these are restaurants that had dying. These are businesses with no money. Putting up plexiglass is unbelievably expensive, and it’s not the answer. I mean, you’re going to sit there in a cubicle wrapped around with plastic. These are businesses that are dying, Joe. You can’t do that to people. You just can’t. Take a look at New York and what’s happened to my wonderful city. For so many years, I loved it. It was vibrant. It’s dying. Everyone’s leaving New York., Kristen, New York has lost more than 40,000 people, 11,000 people in nursing homes., When you say spike, take a look at what’s happening in Pennsylvania where they’ve had it closed. Take a look at what’s happening with your friend in Michigan, where her husband’s the only one allowed to do anything. It’s been like a prison. Now, it was just ruled unconstitutional. Take a look at North Carolina, they’re having spikes and they’ve been closed, and they’re getting killed financially. We can’t let that happen, Joe. You can’t let that happen. We have to open up. And we understand the disease. We have to protect our seniors. We have to protect our elderly. We have to protect especially our seniors with heart problems and diabetes problems. And we will protect. We have the best testing in the world by far. That’s why we have so many cases., I’m listening to all of them, including Anthony. I get along very well with Anthony., … think to all of them, including Anthony. I get along very well with Anthony, but he did say, “Don’t wear masks.” He did say, as you know, “This is not going to be a problem.” I think he’s a Democrat, but that’s okay. He said, “This is not going to be a problem. We are not going to have a problem at all.” When Joe says that I said, Anthony Fauci said, and others, and many others. And I’m not knocking him, nobody knew. Look, nobody knew what this thing was. Nobody knew where it was coming from, what it was. We’ve learned a lot. But Anthony said “Don’t wear masks,” now he wants to wear masks. Anthony also said, if you look back, exact words, here’s his exact words. “This is no problem. This is going to go away soon.” So he’s allowed to make mistakes. He happens to be a good person., Well, this is what I-, [crosstalk 00:28:34] I don’t know. Somebody went through Wall Street. You’re the one that takes all the money from Wall Street. I don’t take it., Joe, you have raised a lot of money, tremendous amounts of money. And every time you raise money deals are made, Joe. I could raise so much more money. As President, and as somebody that knows most of those people, I could call the heads of Wall Street, the heads of every company in America. I would blow away every record. But I don’t want to do that because it puts me in a bad position. And then you bring up Wall Street? You shouldn’t be bringing up Wall Street, because you’re the one that takes the money from Wall Street, not me. I could blow away your records like you wouldn’t believe. We don’t need money. We have plenty of money. In fact, we beat Hillary Clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was able to [crosstalk 00:29:15], Don’t tell me about [crosstalk 00:29:17]., Well, let me respond to the first part, as Joe answered. Joe got $3.5 million from Russia and it came through Putin, because he was very friendly with the former mayor of Moscow and it was the mayor of Moscow’s wife. And you got $3.5 million. Your family got $3.5 million. And someday you’re going to have to explain, why did you get three and a half? I never got any money from Russia. I don’t get money from Russia., Now, about your thing last night. I knew all about that. And through John — who is John Ratcliffe, who is fantastic, DNI — he said the one thing that’s common to both of them., They both want you to lose because there has been nobody tougher to Russia between the sanctions, nobody tougher than me on Russia, between the sanctions, between all of what I’ve done with NATO. I’ve got the NATO countries to put up an extra $130 billion going to $420 billion a year. That’s to guard against Russia. I sold, while he was selling pillows and sheets, I sold tank busters to Ukraine. There has been nobody tougher on Russia than Donald Trump., And I’ll tell you, they were so bad. They took over the submarine port, you remember that very well, during your term, during you and Barack Obama. They took over a big part of what should have been Ukraine. You handed it to them. But you were getting a lot of money from Russia. They were paying you a lot of money, and they probably still are. But now, with what came out today, it’s even worse. All of the emails, the emails, the horrible emails of the kind of money that you were raking in, you and your family. And Joe, you were vice-president when some of this was happening, and it should have never happened. And I think you owe an explanation to the American people. Why is it, somebody just had a news conference a little while ago who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family, but what he said was damning. And regardless of me, I think you have to clean it up and talk to the American people. Maybe you can do it right now., First of all, I called my accountants, underwrote it, I’m going to release them as soon as we can. I want to do it. And it’ll show how successful, how great this company is. But much more importantly than that, people were saying $750. I asked them a week ago, I said, “What did I pay?” They said, “Sir, you prepaid tens of millions of dollars.” I prepaid my tax, over the last number of years, tens of millions of dollars, I prepaid, because at some point, they think it’s an estimate. They think I may have to pay tax. So I already prepaid it. Nobody told me that. Nobody told you that., Excuse me. And it wasn’t written. Whenever they write this, they keep talking about $750, which I think is a filing fee, but let me just tell you, I prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes, number one., Number two, I don’t make money from China. You do. I don’t make money from Ukraine. You do. I don’t make money from Russia. You made $3.5 million, Joe, and your son gave you, they even have a statement that we have to give 10% to the big man. You’re the big man, I think. I don’t know, maybe you’re not, but you’re the big man, I think. Your son said we have to give 10% to the big men. Joe, what’s that all about? It’s terrible., As soon as the auditors finish. I get treated worse than the tea party got treated, because I have a lot of people in there-, … deep down in the IRS, they treat me horribly. We made a deal, it was all settled until I decide to run for president. I get treated very badly by the IRS, very unfairly, but we had a deal all done. As soon as we’re completed with the deal, I want to release it, but I have paid millions and millions of dollars and it’s worse than paying. I paid in advance. It’s called prepaying your taxes. I paid [crosstalk 00:04:32]., Everybody knows., So…, I was put through a phony witch hunt for three years. It started before I even got elected. They spied of my campaign. No president should ever have to go through what I went through. Let me just say this, Mueller and 18 angry Democrats and FBI agents all over the place spent $48 million. They went through everything I had, including my tax returns, and they found absolutely no collusion and nothing wrong. $48 million. I guarantee you, if I spent $1 million on you, Joe, I could find plenty wrong because the kind of things-, … that you’ve done and the kind of monies that your family has taken, I mean, your brother made money in Iraq-, … millions of dollars. Your other brother made a fortune, and it’s all through you, Joe. And they say you get some of it. And you do live very well, you have houses all over the place. You live very well., [crosstalk 00:07:25]…, But could I just one thing?, His son didn’t have a job for a long time, was, sadly, no longer in the military service, I won’t get into that, and he didn’t have a job. As soon as he became vice-president, Burisma, not the best reputation in the world, I hear they paid him $183,000 a month, listen to this, $183,000, and they gave him a $3 million upfront payment, and he had no energy experience. That’s 100% dishonest., I have many bank accounts and they’re all listed and they’re all over the place. I mean, I was a businessman doing business. The bank account you’re referring to, which is, everybody knows about it, it’s listed, the bank account was in 2013. That’s what it was. It was opened. It was closed in 2015, I believe. And then I decided, because I was going to do… I was thinking about doing a deal in China, like millions of other people, I was thinking about it and I decided I’m not going to do it, didn’t like it, I decided not to do it, had an account open and I closed it., Excuse me. And then, unlike him where he’s vice-president and he does business, I then decided to run for president after that. That was before. So I closed it before I even ran for president, let alone became president, big difference. He is the vice-president of the United States and his son, his brother, and his other brother are getting rich. They’re like a vacuum cleaner. They’re sucking up money [crosstalk 00:09:20]., No, no, no., Excuse me. No, I have to…, Excuse me. No, I have to respond to that., His son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from China to …, … after spending 10 minutes in office and being in Air Force Two. Number one. Number two, there’s a very strong email talking about your family wanting to make $10 million a year for introductions., No, but wait a minute., First of all, China is paying. They’re paying billions and billions of dollars. I just gave $28 billion., I just gave $28 billion to our farmers., It’s what?, No, no. You know who the taxpayer is? It’s called China., China pays 28 billion, and you know what they did to pay it, Joe? They devalued their currency and they also paid up, and you know got the money? Our farmers, our great farmers, because they were targeted. You never charged them anything. Also, I charged them 25% on dumped steel, because they were killing our steel industry. We were not going to have a steel industry., And now we have a steel industry., That is a typical statement., Excuse me. Just for one second, please., That’s a typical political statement. Let’s get off this China thing, and then he looks, “The family around the table, everything.” Just a typical politician when I see that. I’m not a typical politician., That’s why I got elected. Let’s get off the subject of China. Let’s talk about sitting around the table. Come on, Joe. You could do better., No., So when I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House, right at the beginning, had a great conversation. Was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour. He said, “The biggest problem we have is North Korea.” He indicated we will be in a war with North Korea. Guess what? It would be a nuclear war. And he does have plenty of nuclear capability. In the meantime, I have a very good relationship with him. Different kind of a guy, but he probably thinks the same thing about me. We have a different kind of a relationship. We have a very good relationship and there’s no war. And about two months ago, he broke into a certain area. They said, “Oh, there’s going to be trouble.” I said, “No, they’re not, because he’s not going to do that.” And I was right. Look, instead of being in a war where millions of people, Seoul is 25 miles away, millions and millions, 32 million people. Millions of people would be dead right now. We don’t have a war and I have a good relationship., Kristen., They tried to meet with him. He wouldn’t do it. He didn’t like Obama. He didn’t like him. He wouldn’t do it., I know for a fact. They tried. We wouldn’t do it. And that’s okay. You know what? North Korea, we’re not in a war. We have a good relationship. People don’t understand. Having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing., And it didn’t happen., Excuse me. He left me a mess. Kristen., They left me a mess. North Korea was a mess, and in fact, if you remember the first two or three months. It was a very dangerous period in my first three months before we worked things out a little bit., There was a very day. They left us a mess, and Obama would be, I think, the first to say it, was the single biggest problem he thought that our country [crosstalk 00:17:03]., First of all, I’ve already done something that nobody thought was possible. Through the legislature, I terminated the individual mandate. That is the worst part of Obamacare, as we call it. The individual mandate where you have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance, I terminated. It’s gone. Now, it’s in court, because Obamacare is no good. But then I made a decision, run it as well as you can, to my people, great people, run it as well as you can. I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy. They ran it. Premiums are down. Everything’s down. Here’s the problem. No matter how well you run it, it’s no good. What we’d like to do is terminate it. We have the individual mandate done. I don’t know that it’s going to work. If we don’t win, we will have to run it and we’ll have Obamacare, but it’ll be better run. But it no longer is Obamacare, because without the individual mandate, it’s much different., Pre-existing conditions will always stay. What I would like to do is a much better healthcare, much better. We’ll always protect people with pre-existing. So I’d like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new, beautiful healthcare. The Democrats will do it, because there’ll be tremendous pressure on them. And we might even have the House by that time. And I think we’re going to win the House. You’ll see, but I think we’re going to win the House. But come up with a better healthcare, always protecting people with pre-existing conditions. And one thing very important, we have 180 million people out there that have great private healthcare. Far more than we’re talking about with Obamacare. Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies. These are people that love their healthcare. People that have been successful, middle-income people, been successful. They have 180 million plans, 180 million people, families. Under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine, he won’t even have a choice, they want to terminate 180 million plans. We have done an incredible job at healthcare, and we’re going to do even better. Just you watch., Excuse me. He was there-, … for 47 years. He didn’t do it. He was now there as vice president for eight years. And it’s not like it was 25 years ago. It was three and three quarters… It was just a little while ago, right? Less than four years ago. He didn’t do anything. He didn’t do it. He wants socialized medicine. And it’s not that he wants it. His vice president, she is more liberal than Bernie Sanders and wants it even more. Bernie Sanders wants it. The Democrats want it. You’re going to have socialized medicine, just like you want it with fracking. “We’re not going to have fracking. We’re going to stop fracking. We’re going to stop fracking.” Then he goes to Pennsylvania after he gets a nomination, where he got very lucky to get it. And he goes to Pennsylvania, and he says, “Oh, we’re going to have fracking.” And you never ask that question. And by the way, so far, I respect very much the way you’re handling this, I have to say., But somebody should ask the question., He goes for a year, there will be no fracking., There will be no petroleum-, No, no. But that’s a big question., It’s the same thing with socialized medicine., Kristen, when he says-, When he says public option, he’s talking about socialized medicine and healthcare. When he talks about a public option, he’s talking about destroying your Medicare, totally destroying-, … and destroying your Social Security. And this whole country will come down. Bernie Sanders tried it in his state., He tried it in his state. His governor was a very liberal governor. They wanted to make it work., It was impossible to work., It doesn’t work., He tried to get rid of-, He tried to hurt Social Security years ago. Years ago. Go back and look at the records. He tried to hurt Social Security years ago. One thing. But this is the guy-, … that when they announced last week-, They say the stock market will boom if I’m elected. If he’s elected, the stock market will crash., The biggest analysts are saying that., 401(k)s. Kristen, 401(k)s are through the roof., People’s stock are through the roof., And he doesn’t come from Scranton. He lived there for a short period of time before he even knew it., And he left. And the people of Pennsylvania will show you that., They understand., Because Nancy Pelosi doesn’t want to approve it. I do., I do. But I still have to get, unfortunately… That’s one of the reasons I think we’re going to take over the House, because of her. Nancy Pelosi doesn’t want to approve anything because she’d love to have some victories on a date called November 3rd. Nancy Pelosi does not want to approve it. We are ready, willing, and able to do something. Don’t forget, we’ve already approved three plans. And it’s gone through, including the Democrats, in all fairness. This one, she doesn’t want. It’s near the election. Because she thinks it helps her politically. I think it hurts her politically., If we made a deal, the Republicans will pass it., The bill that was passed in the House was a bailout of badly run, high crime, Democrat, all run by Democrat cities and states. It was a way of getting a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars, to these guys. It was also a way of getting a lot of money from our people’s pockets to people that come into our country illegally. We were going to take care of everything for them. And I’d love to do that. I’d love to help them. But what that does, everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country. We can’t do it. This was a way of taking care of them. This was a way of spending on things that had nothing to do with COVID, as per your question. But it was really a big bailout for badly run Democrat cities and states., Excuse me. One thing very quickly. He said we have to help our small businesses by raising the minimum wage. That’s not helping. I think it should be a state option. Alabama is different than New York. New York is different from Vermont. Every state is different. It should be a state option., It’s very important. We have to help our small businesses., How are you helping your small businesses when you’re forcing wages? What’s going to happen, and what’s been proven to happen, is when you do that, these small businesses fire many of their employees., Say it. Say it., What I really like, and I would consider it to an extent-, But what I really like… In a second administration. But not to a level that’s going to put all these businesses out of business. It should be a state option. Look, I’ve lived-, … in different places. I know different places. They’re all different. Some places, $ 15 is not so bad. In other places, other states, $15 would be ruinings., Children are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people, cartels…, [inaudible 00:33:00] and lots of bad people, cartels, and they’re brought here and they used to use them to get into our country. We now have as strong a border as we’ve ever had. We’re over 400 miles of brand new wall. You see the numbers. And we let people in, but they have to come in legally and they come in through [crosstalk 00:00:17]-, But let me just tell you. Let me just tell you. They built cages. They used to say I built the cages, and then they had a picture in a certain newspaper, and it was the picture of these horrible cages and they said, “Look at these cages. President Trump built them.” And then it was determined they were built in 2014. That was him. They built cages., Yes. We’re working on it very… We’re trying very hard. But a lot of these kids come out without the parents. They come over through cartels and through coyotes and through gangs., Kristen, they did it. We changed the policy. They did it. We changed., They built the cages. Who built the cages, Joe?, Kristen, I will say this. They went down. We brought reporters, everything. They are so well taken care of. They’re in facilities that were so clean., They have gotten such good… But just ask one question. Who built the cages? I’d love you to ask him that. Who built the cages, Joe?, Kristen, he had eight years to do what he said he was going to do. And I’ve changed. Without having a specific, we got rid of catch and release. We got rid of a lot of horrible things that they put in and that they lived with. But he had eight years he was Vice President. He did nothing except build cages to keep children in., So important. It just shows that he has no understanding of immigration, of the laws. Catch and release is a disaster. A murderer would come in. A rapist would come in. A very bad person would come in. We would take their name. We have to release them into our country. And then you say they come back. Less than 1% of the people come back. We have to send ICE out and Border Patrol out to find them. We would say, “Come back in two years, three years. We’re going to give you a court case. You did Perry Mason. We’re going to give you a court case.” When you say they come back, they don’t come back, Joe. They never come back. Only the really… I hate to say this, but those with the lowest IQ, they might come back, but there are very, very few., You don’t know the law, Joe., Well, check it out. They don’t come back., But we don’t have to worry about it, because they terminated it. So we don’t have to worry about it anymore, Joe., Go ahead., Yes, I do. And again, he’s been in government 47 years, he never did a thing, except in 1994, when he did such harm to the black community, and they were called … and he called them superpredators. And he said that, he said it, superpredators. And they never lived that down. 1994, your crime bill, the superpredators. Nobody has done more for the black community than Donald Trump. And if you look, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln, possible exception, but the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done what I’ve done. Criminal justice reform, Obama and Joe didn’t do it. I don’t even think they tried because they had no chance at doing it. They might’ve wanted to do it. But if you had to see the arms I had to twist to get that done, it was not a pretty picture. And everybody knows it, including some very liberal people that cried in my office. They cried in the Oval Office., Two weeks later, they’re out saying, “Gee, we have to defeat him.” Criminal justice reform, prison reform, Opportunity Zones with Tim Scott, a great Senator from South Carolina. He came in with this incredible idea for Opportunity Zones. It’s one of the most successful programs. People don’t talk about it. Tremendous investment is being made, biggest beneficiary, the black and Hispanic communities. And then Historically Black Colleges and Universities, after three years of coming to the office, I love some of those guys, they were great. They came into the office and I said, “What are you doing?” After three years, I said, “Why do you keep coming back?” Because we have no funding.” I said, “You don’t have to come back every year.” “We have to come back.”, Because President Obama would never give them long-term funding and I did. 10 year long-term funding and I gave them more money than they asked for because I said, “I think you need more.” And I said, “The only bad part about this is I may never see you again.” Because I got very friendly with them and they like me and I like them. But I saved Historically Black Colleges and Universities., But why didn’t he do it four years ago? Why didn’t you do that four years ago? Even less than that. Why didn’t you when you vice president? You keep talking about all these things you’re going to do, and you’re going to do this, but you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing., You know Joe, I ran because of you. I ran because of Barack Obama, because you did a poor job. If I thought you did a good job, I would’ve never run. I would’ve never run. I ran because of you. I’m looking at you now, you’re a politician, I ran because of you., Excuse me-, If this stuff is true about Russia, Ukraine, China, other countries, Iraq. If this is true, then he’s a corrupt politician. So don’t give me the stuff about how you’re this innocent baby. Joe, that calling you a corrupt politician-, They’re calling it the laptop from hell., Excuse me, [crosstalk 00:06:13] the laptop from hell., You mean the laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax? You got to be kidding me-, This is where he’s going. The laptop is Russia, Russia, Russia?, You have to be kidding, here we go again with the Russia. Boy, oh, boy., Can’t believe that one., Well, you have to understand the first time I ever heard of Black Lives Matter, they were chanting, “Pigs in a blanket,” talking about police, pigs, pigs, talking about our police. “Pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon.” I said, “That’s a horrible thing.” And they were marching down the street. And that was my first glimpse of Black Lives Matter, I thought it was a terrible thing. As far as my relationships with all people, I think I have great relationships with all people. I am the least racist person in this room., I don’t know. I mean, I don’t know what to say. I got criminal justice reform done and prison reform and Opportunity Zones-, … got criminal justice reform done, and prison reform, and Opportunity Zones, I took care of Black colleges and universities, I don’t know what to say, they can say anything, I mean, they can say anything. It’s a very… Makes me sad, because I am the least racist person, I can’t even see the audience because it’s so dark, but I don’t care who’s in the audience, I’m the least racist person in this room., No, he made a reference to Abraham Lincoln, where did that come in? I mean-, … where did that….. No., I said, “Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I’ve done for the Black community.”, I didn’t say, “I’m Abraham Lincoln,” I said, “Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I’ve done for the Black community.” Now, you have done nothing other than the Crime Bill, which put-, Tens of thousands of Black men, mostly, in jail., And you know what? They remember it because if you look at what’s happening with the voting right now, they remember that you treated them very, very badly, just take a look at what’s happening out there., But, why didn’t he get it done? See, it’s all talk, no action with these politicians, why didn’t he get it? “That’s what I’m going to do when I become president.” You were vice president along with Obama as your president, your leader, for eight years, why didn’t you get it done? You had eight years to get it done, now you’re saying you’re going to get it done because you’re all talking and no action, Joe., You didn’t get anything done., You got nothing done., I just have-, … one question, why didn’t you do it in the eight years, a short time ago? Why didn’t you do it? You just said, “I’m going to do that, I’m going to do this.” You put tens of thousands of mostly Black young men in prison, now you’re saying you’re going to get… You’re going to undo that, why didn’t you get it done? You had eight years with Obama. You know why, Joe? Because you’re all talk and no action., Well, you got to talk them into it, Joe, sometimes you got to talk them into it., … like I did with criminal justice reform, I had to talk Democrats into it., So, we have the trillion trees program, we have so many different programs, I do love the environment, but what I want is that cleanest crystal clear water, the cleanest air. We have the best lowest number in carbon emissions, which is a big standard that I noticed Obama goes with all the time, not Joe, I haven’t heard Joe use the term because I’m not sure he knows what it represents or means, but I have heard Obama use it. And we have the best carbon emission numbers that we’ve had in 35 years under this administration, we are working so well with industry, but here’s what we can’t do. Look at China, how filthy it is, look at Russia, look at India, it’s filthy, the air is filthy. The [Paris Accord 00:00:13:55], I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly., When they put us in there, they did us a great disservice, they were going to take away our businesses. I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the Paris Accord, it was so unfair. China doesn’t kick in until 2030, Russia goes back to a low standard, and we kicked in right away, it would have been… It would have destroyed our businesses. So, you ready? We have done an incredible job environmentally, we have the cleanest air, the cleanest water, and the best carbon emission standards that we’ve seen in many, many years., And we haven’t destroyed our industries., They came out and said very strongly $6,500 will be taken away from families under his plan, that his plan is an economic disaster. If you look at what he wants to do, if you look at his plan, his-, … his environmental plan, do you know developed it? AOC plus three, they know nothing about the climate. I mean, she’s got a good line of stuff, but she knows nothing about the climate and they’re all hopping through hoops for AOC plus three. Look, their real plan cost a hundred trillion dollars. If we had the best year in the history of our country for a hundred years, we would not even come close to a number like that. When he says buildings, they want to take buildings down because they want to make bigger windows into smaller windows. As far as they’re concerned, if you had no window, it would be a lovely thing., This is the craziest plan that anybody has ever seen and this wasn’t done by smart people. This wasn’t done by anybody. Frankly, I don’t even know how it can be good politically. They want to spend a hundred trillion dollars. That’s their real number. He’s trying to say it was six. It’s a hundred trillion dollars. They want to knock down buildings and build new buildings with little, tiny, small windows and many other things-, And many other things. And many other things., It is crazy., You’ll destroy our country., Excuse me., We are energy independent for first time. We don’t need all of these countries that we had to fight war over because we needed their energy. We are energy independent. I know more about wind than you do. It’s extremely expensive. Kills all the birds. It’s very intermittent. It’s got a lot of problems and they happen to make the windmills in both Germany and China and the fumes coming up, if you’re a believer in carbon emission, the fumes coming up to make these massive windmills is more than anything that we’re talking about with natural gas, which is very clear., One other thing, solar-, I love solar, but solar doesn’t quite have it yet. It’s not powerful yet to really run our big, beautiful factories that we need to compete with the world., It’s all a pipe dream, but you know what we’ll do? We’re going to have the greatest economy in the world, but if you want to kill the economy, get rid of your oil industry you want. And what about fracking?, Now we have to ask him about fracking., You said it on tape., I’ll put it on., Excuse me. He was against fracking. He said it. I will show that to you tomorrow., I am against fracking. Until he got the nomination, he went to Pennsylvania. Then he said, “But you know what Pennsylvania?” He’ll be against it very soon because his party is totally against it., The families that we’re talking about are employed heavily and they are making a lot of money, more money than they’ve ever made. If you look at the kind of numbers that we’ve produced for Hispanic, for Black, for Asian, it’s nine times greater the percentage gain than it was under in three years than it was under eight years of the two of them to put it nicely, nine times more., Now somebody lives, I have not heard the numbers or the statistics that you’re saying, but they’re making a tremendous amount of money. Economically, we saved it and I saved it again a number of months ago, when oil was crashing because of the pandemic. We saved it., Say what you want to bet relationship. We got Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Russia to cut back, way back. We saved our oil industry and now it’s very vibrant again and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline. Remember that., Would he close down the oil industry?, Would you close dow the oil industry?, Oh, that’s a big statement., That’s a big statement., Oh, I see. Okay., That’s a big statement., Yeah., We actually give it to solar and wind. That’s maybe the biggest statement. In terms of business, that’s the biggest statement., Because basically what he’s saying is-, … he is going to destroy the oil industry. Will you remember that Texas? Will you remember that Pennsylvania, Oklahoma?, Remember that Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, is-, Ohio., Is he going to get China to do it?, Is he going to get China to do it?, [Crosstalk 00:24:31]., We have to make our country totally successful, as it was prior to the plague coming in from China. Now we’re rebuilding it and we’re doing record numbers, 11.4 million jobs in a short period of time, et cetera. But, I will tell you, go back., Before the plague came in, just before, I was getting calls from people that were not normally people that would call me. They wanted to get together. We had the best Black unemployment numbers in the history of our country. Hispanic, women, Asian, people with diplomas, with no diplomas, MIT graduates; number one in the class, everybody had the best numbers. And you know what? The other side wanted to get together. They wanted to unify., Success is going to bring us together. We are on the road to success. But I’m cutting taxes, and he wants to raise everybody’s taxes and he wants to put new regulations on everything. He will kill it. If he gets in, you will have a Depression, the likes of which you’ve never seen. Your 401(k)s will go to hell, and it’ll be a very, very sad day for this country.'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":29}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BEt9ScM9OqxU"},"source":["#### Pre-processing the

doing how are you so as you know million people modeled out were expected to die we closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from china it s a worldwide pandemic it s all over the world you see the spikes in europe and many other places right now if you notice the mortality rate is down the excess mortality rate is way down and much lower than almost any other country and we re fighting it and we re fighting it hard there is a spike there was a spike in florida and it s now gone there was a very big spike in texas it s now gone there was a very big spike in arizona it s now gone and there was some spikes and surges and other places they will soon be gone we have a vaccine that s coming it s ready it s going to be announced within weeks and it s going to be delivered we have operation warp speed which is the military is going to distribute the vaccine i can tell you from personal experience i was in the hospital i had it and i got better and i will tell you that i had something that they gave me a therapeutic i guess they would call it some people could say it was a cure but i was in for a short period of time and i got better very fast or i wouldn t be here tonight and now they say i m immune whether it s four months or a lifetime nobody s been able to say that but i m immune more and more people are getting better we have a problem that s a worldwide problem this is a worldwide problem but i ve been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we ve been able to do if you take a look at what we ve done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else and in particular ventilators we re now making ventilators all over the world thousands and thousands a month distributing them all over the world it will go away and as i say we re rounding the turn we re rounding the corner it s going away no it s not a guarantee but it will be by the end of the year but i think it has a good chance there are two companies i think within a matter of weeks and it will be distributed very quickly johnson johnson is doing very well moderna is doing very well pfizer is doing very well and we have numerous others then we also have others that we re working on very closely with other countries in particular europe no i think my timeline is going to be more accurate i don t know that they re counting on the military the way i do but we have our generals lined up one in particular that s the head of logistics and this is a very easy distribution for him he s ready to go as soon as we have the vaccine and we expect to have a million vials as soon as we have the vaccine he s ready to go i don t think we re going to have a dark winter at all we re opening up our country we ve learned and studied and understand the disease which we didn t at the beginning when i closed and banned china from coming in heavily infected and then ultimately europe but china was in january months later he was saying i was xenophobic i did it too soon now he s saying oh i should have moved quicker but he didn t move quicker he was months behind me many months behind me and frankly he ran the h n swine flu and it was a total disaster far less lethal but it was a total disaster had that had this kind of numbers people would be dead right now but it was a far less lethal disease look his own person who ran that for him who as you know was his chief of staff said it was catastrophic it was horrible we didn t know what we were doing now he comes up and he tells us how to do this also everything that he said about the way every single move that he said we should make that s what we ve done we ve done all of it but he was way behind us of people recover we have to recover we can t close up our nation we have to open our school and we can t close up our nation or you re not going to have a nation excuse me i take full responsibility it s not my fault that it came here it s china s fault and you know what it s not joe s fault that it came here either it s china s fault they kept it from going into the rest of china for the most part but they didn t keep it from coming out to the world including europe and ourselves look perhaps just to finish this i was kidding on that but just to finish this when i closed he said i shouldn t have closed and that went on for months nancy pelosi said the same thing she was dancing on the streets in chinatown in san francisco but when i closed he said this is a terrible thing you xenophobic i think he called me racist even because i was closing it to china now he says i should have closed it earlier joe it doesn t you certainly did you certainly did he thought i shouldn t have closed the border that s obvious i think we have to respond if i might thank you and i appreciate that look all he does is talk about shut downs but forget about him his democrat governors cuomo in new york you look at what s going on in california you look at pennsylvania north carolina democrats democrats all they re shut down so tight and they re dying they re dying and he supports all these people all he talks about is shut downs no we re not going to shut down and we have to open our schools and it s like as an example i have a young son he also tested positive by the time i spoke to the doctor the second time he was fine it just went away young people i guess it s their immune system i want to open the schools the transmittal rate to the teachers is very small but i want to open the schools we have to open our country we re not going to have a country you can t do this we can t keep this country closed this is a massive country with a massive economy people are losing their jobs they re committing suicide there s depression alcohol drugs at a level that nobody s ever seen before there s abuse tremendous abuse we have to open our country i ve said it often the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself and that s what s happening and he wants to close down he ll close down the country if one person in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down by the way i will say this if you go and look at what s happened to new york it s a ghost town it s a ghost town and when you talk about plexiglass these are restaurants that had dying these are businesses with no money putting up plexiglass is unbelievably expensive and it s not the answer i mean you re going to sit there in a cubicle wrapped around with plastic these are businesses that are dying joe you can t do that to people you just can t take a look at new york and what s happened to my wonderful city for so many years i loved it it was vibrant it s dying everyone s leaving new york kristen new york has lost more than people people in nursing homes when you say spike take a look at what s happening in pennsylvania where they ve had it closed take a look at what s happening with your friend in michigan where her husband s the only one allowed to do anything it s been like a prison now it was just ruled unconstitutional take a look at north carolina they re having spikes and they ve been closed and they re getting killed financially we can t let that happen joe you can t let that happen we have to open up and we understand the disease we have to protect our seniors we have to protect our elderly we have to protect especially our seniors with heart problems and diabetes problems and we will protect we have the best testing in the world by far that s why we have so many cases i m listening to all of them including anthony i get along very well with anthony think to all of them including anthony i get along very well with anthony but he did say don t wear masks he did say as you know this is not going to be a problem i think he s a democrat but that s okay he said this is not going to be a problem we are not going to have a problem at all when joe says that i said anthony fauci said and others and many others and i m not knocking him nobody knew look nobody knew what this thing was nobody knew where it was coming from what it was we ve learned a lot but anthony said don t wear masks now he wants to wear masks anthony also said if you look back exact words here s his exact words this is no problem this is going to go away soon so he s allowed to make mistakes he happens to be a good person well this is what i crosstalk i don t know somebody went through wall street you re the one that takes all the money from wall street i don t take it joe you have raised a lot of money tremendous amounts of money and every time you raise money deals are made joe i could raise so much more money as president and as somebody that knows most of those people i could call the heads of wall street the heads of every company in america i would blow away every record but i don t want to do that because it puts me in a bad position and then you bring up wall street you shouldn t be bringing up wall street because you re the one that takes the money from wall street not me i could blow away your records like you wouldn t believe we don t need money we have plenty of money in fact we beat hillary clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was able to crosstalk don t tell me about crosstalk well let me respond to the first part as joe answered joe got million from russia and it came through putin because he was very friendly with the former mayor of moscow and it was the mayor of moscow s wife and you got million your family got million and someday you re going to have to explain why did you get three and a half i never got any money from russia i don t get money from russia now about your thing last night i knew all about that and through john who is john ratcliffe who is fantastic dni he said the one thing that s common to both of them they both want you to lose because there has been nobody tougher to russia between the sanctions nobody tougher than me on russia between the sanctions between all of what i ve done with nato i ve got the nato countries to put up an extra billion going to billion a year that s to guard against russia i sold while he was selling pillows and sheets i sold tank busters to ukraine there has been nobody tougher on russia than donald trump and i ll tell you they were so bad they took over the submarine port you remember that very well during your term during you and barack obama they took over a big part of what should have been ukraine you handed it to them but you were getting a lot of money from russia they were paying you a lot of money and they probably still are but now with what came out today it s even worse all of the emails the emails the horrible emails of the kind of money that you were raking in you and your family and joe you were vice president when some of this was happening and it should have never happened and i think you owe an explanation to the american people why is it somebody just had a news conference a little while ago who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family but what he said was damning and regardless of me i think you have to clean it up and talk to the american people maybe you can do it right now first of all i called my accountants underwrote it i m going to release them as soon as we can i want to do it and it ll show how successful how great this company is but much more importantly than that people were saying i asked them a week ago i said what did i pay they said sir you prepaid tens of millions of dollars i prepaid my tax over the last number of years tens of millions of dollars i prepaid because at some point they think it s an estimate they think i may have to pay tax so i already prepaid it nobody told me that nobody told you that excuse me and it wasn t written whenever they write this they keep talking about which i think is a filing fee but let me just tell you i prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes number one number two i don t make money from china you do i don t make money from ukraine you do i don t make money from russia you made million joe and your son gave you they even have a statement that we have to give to the big man you re the big man i think i don t know maybe you re not but you re the big man i think your son said we have to give to the big men joe what s that all about it s terrible as soon as the auditors finish i get treated worse than the tea party got treated because i have a lot of people in there deep down in the irs they treat me horribly we made a deal it was all settled until i decide to run for president i get treated very badly by the irs very unfairly but we had a deal all done as soon as we re completed with the deal i want to release it but i have paid millions and millions of dollars and it s worse than paying i paid in advance it s called prepaying your taxes i paid crosstalk everybody knows so i was put through a phony witch hunt for three years it started before i even got elected they spied of my campaign no president should ever have to go through what i went through let me just say this mueller and angry democrats and fbi agents all over the place spent million they went through everything i had including my tax returns and they found absolutely no collusion and nothing wrong million i guarantee you if i spent million on you joe i could find plenty wrong because the kind of things that you ve done and the kind of monies that your family has taken i mean your brother made money in iraq millions of dollars your other brother made a fortune and it s all through you joe and they say you get some of it and you do live very well you have houses all over the place you live very well crosstalk but could i just one thing his son didn t have a job for a long time was sadly no longer in the military service i won t get into that and he didn t have a job as soon as he became vice president burisma not the best reputation in the world i hear they paid him a month listen to this and they gave him a million upfront payment and he had no energy experience that s dishonest i have many bank accounts and they re all listed and they re all over the place i mean i was a businessman doing business the bank account you re referring to which is everybody knows about it it s listed the bank account was in that s what it was it was opened it was closed in i believe and then i decided because i was going to do i was thinking about doing a deal in china like millions of other people i was thinking about it and i decided i m not going to do it didn t like it i decided not to do it had an account open and i closed it excuse me and then unlike him where he s vice president and he does business i then decided to run for president after that that was before so i closed it before i even ran for president let alone became president big difference he is the vice president of the united states and his son his brother and his other brother are getting rich they re like a vacuum cleaner they re sucking up money crosstalk no no no excuse me no i have to excuse me no i have to respond to that his son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from china to after spending minutes in office and being in air force two number one number two there s a very strong email talking about your family wanting to make million a year for introductions no but wait a minute first of all china is paying they re paying billions and billions of dollars i just gave billion i just gave billion to our farmers it s what no no you know who the taxpayer is it s called china china pays billion and you know what they did to pay it joe they devalued their currency and they also paid up and you know got the money our farmers our great farmers because they were targeted you never charged them anything also i charged them on dumped steel because they were killing our steel industry we were not going to have a steel industry and now we have a steel industry that is a typical statement excuse me just for one second please that s a typical political statement let s get off this china thing and then he looks the family around the table everything just a typical politician when i see that i m not a typical politician that s why i got elected let s get off the subject of china let s talk about sitting around the table come on joe you could do better no so when i met with barack obama we sat in the white house right at the beginning had a great conversation was supposed to be minutes and it was well over an hour he said the biggest problem we have is north korea he indicated we will be in a war with north korea guess what it would be a nuclear war and he does have plenty of nuclear capability in the meantime i have a very good relationship with him different kind of a guy but he probably thinks the same thing about me we have a different kind of a relationship we have a very good relationship and there s no war and about two months ago he broke into a certain area they said oh there s going to be trouble i said no they re not because he s not going to do that and i was right look instead of being in a war where millions of people seoul is miles away millions and millions million people millions of people would be dead right now we don t have a war and i have a good relationship kristen they tried to meet with him he wouldn t do it he didn t like obama he didn t like him he wouldn t do it i know for a fact they tried we wouldn t do it and that s okay you know what north korea we re not in a war we have a good relationship people don t understand having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing and it didn t happen excuse me he left me a mess kristen they left me a mess north korea was a mess and in fact if you remember the first two or three months it was a very dangerous period in my first three months before we worked things out a little bit there was a very day they left us a mess and obama would be i think the first to say it was the single biggest problem he thought that our country crosstalk first of all i ve already done something that nobody thought was possible through the legislature i terminated the individual mandate that is the worst part of obamacare as we call it the individual mandate where you have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance i terminated it s gone now it s in court because obamacare is no good but then i made a decision run it as well as you can to my people great people run it as well as you can i could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy they ran it premiums are down everything s down here s the problem no matter how well you run it it s no good what we d like to do is terminate it we have the individual mandate done i don t know that it s going to work if we don t win we will have to run it and we ll have obamacare but it ll be better run but it no longer is obamacare because without the individual mandate it s much different pre existing conditions will always stay what i would like to do is a much better healthcare much better we ll always protect people with pre existing so i d like to terminate obamacare come up with a brand new beautiful healthcare the democrats will do it because there ll be tremendous pressure on them and we might even have the house by that time and i think we re going to win the house you ll see but i think we re going to win the house but come up with a better healthcare always protecting people with pre existing conditions and one thing very important we have million people out there that have great private healthcare far more than we re talking about with obamacare joe biden is going to terminate all of those policies these are people that love their healthcare people that have been successful middle income people been successful they have million plans million people families under what he wants to do which will basically be socialized medicine he won t even have a choice they want to terminate million plans we have done an incredible job at healthcare and we re going to do even better just you watch excuse me he was there for years he didn t do it he was now there as vice president for eight years and it s not like it was years ago it was three and three quarters it was just a little while ago right less than four years ago he didn t do anything he didn t do it he wants socialized medicine and it s not that he wants it his vice president she is more liberal than bernie sanders and wants it even more bernie sanders wants it the democrats want it you re going to have socialized medicine just like you want it with fracking we re not going to have fracking we re going to stop fracking we re going to stop fracking then he goes to pennsylvania after he gets a nomination where he got very lucky to get it and he goes to pennsylvania and he says oh we re going to have fracking and you never ask that question and by the way so far i respect very much the way you re handling this i have to say but somebody should ask the question he goes for a year there will be no fracking there will be no petroleum no no but that s a big question it s the same thing with socialized medicine kristen when he says when he says public option he s talking about socialized medicine and healthcare when he talks about a public option he s talking about destroying your medicare totally destroying and destroying your social security and this whole country will come down bernie sanders tried it in his state he tried it in his state his governor was a very liberal governor they wanted to make it work it was impossible to work it doesn t work he tried to get rid of he tried to hurt social security years ago years ago go back and look at the records he tried to hurt social security years ago one thing but this is the guy that when they announced last week they say the stock market will boom if i m elected if he s elected the stock market will crash the biggest analysts are saying that k s kristen k s are through the roof people s stock are through the roof and he doesn t come from scranton he lived there for a short period of time before he even knew it and he left and the people of pennsylvania will show you that they understand because nancy pelosi doesn t want to approve it i do i do but i still have to get unfortunately that s one of the reasons i think we re going to take over the house because of her nancy pelosi doesn t want to approve anything because she d love to have some victories on a date called november rd nancy pelosi does not want to approve it we are ready willing and able to do something don t forget we ve already approved three plans and it s gone through including the democrats in all fairness this one she doesn t want it s near the election because she thinks it helps her politically i think it hurts her politically if we made a deal the republicans will pass it the bill that was passed in the house was a bailout of badly run high crime democrat all run by democrat cities and states it was a way of getting a lot of money billions and billions of dollars to these guys it was also a way of getting a lot of money from our people s pockets to people that come into our country illegally we were going to take care of everything for them and i d love to do that i d love to help them but what that does everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country we can t do it this was a way of taking care of them this was a way of spending on things that had nothing to do with covid as per your question but it was really a big bailout for badly run democrat cities and states excuse me one thing very quickly he said we have to help our small businesses by raising the minimum wage that s not helping i think it should be a state option alabama is different than new york new york is different from vermont every state is different it should be a state option it s very important we have to help our small businesses how are you helping your small businesses when you re forcing wages what s going to happen and what s been proven to happen is when you do that these small businesses fire many of their employees say it say it what i really like and i would consider it to an extent but what i really like in a second administration but not to a level that s going to put all these businesses out of business it should be a state option look i ve lived in different places i know different places they re all different some places is not so bad in other places other states would be ruinings children are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people cartels inaudible and lots of bad people cartels and they re brought here and they used to use them to get into our country we now have as strong a border as we ve ever had we re over miles of brand new wall you see the numbers and we let people in but they have to come in legally and they come in through crosstalk but let me just tell you let me just tell you they built cages they used to say i built the cages and then they had a picture in a certain newspaper and it was the picture of these horrible cages and they said look at these cages president trump built them and then it was determined they were built in that was him they built cages yes we re working on it very we re trying very hard but a lot of these kids come out without the parents they come over through cartels and through coyotes and through gangs kristen they did it we changed the policy they did it we changed they built the cages who built the cages joe kristen i will say this they went down we brought reporters everything they are so well taken care of they re in facilities that were so clean they have gotten such good but just ask one question who built the cages i d love you to ask him that who built the cages joe kristen he had eight years to do what he said he was going to do and i ve changed without having a specific we got rid of catch and release we got rid of a lot of horrible things that they put in and that they lived with but he had eight years he was vice president he did nothing except build cages to keep children in so important it just shows that he has no understanding of immigration of the laws catch and release is a disaster a murderer would come in a rapist would come in a very bad person would come in we would take their name we have to release them into our country and then you say they come back less than of the people come back we have to send ice out and border patrol out to find them we would say come back in two years three years we re going to give you a court case you did perry mason we re going to give you a court case when you say they come back they don t come back joe they never come back only the really i hate to say this but those with the lowest iq they might come back but there are very very few you don t know the law joe well check it out they don t come back but we don t have to worry about it because they terminated it so we don t have to worry about it anymore joe go ahead yes i do and again he s been in government years he never did a thing except in when he did such harm to the black community and they were called and he called them superpredators and he said that he said it superpredators and they never lived that down your crime bill the superpredators nobody has done more for the black community than donald trump and if you look with the exception of abraham lincoln possible exception but the exception of abraham lincoln nobody has done what i ve done criminal justice reform obama and joe didn t do it i don t even think they tried because they had no chance at doing it they might ve wanted to do it but if you had to see the arms i had to twist to get that done it was not a pretty picture and everybody knows it including some very liberal people that cried in my office they cried in the oval office two weeks later they re out saying gee we have to defeat him criminal justice reform prison reform opportunity zones with tim scott a great senator from south carolina he came in with this incredible idea for opportunity zones it s one of the most successful programs people don t talk about it tremendous investment is being made biggest beneficiary the black and hispanic communities and then historically black colleges and universities after three years of coming to the office i love some of those guys they were great they came into the office and i said what are you doing after three years i said why do you keep coming back because we have no funding i said you don t have to come back every year we have to come back because president obama would never give them long term funding and i did year long term funding and i gave them more money than they asked for because i said i think you need more and i said the only bad part about this is i may never see you again because i got very friendly with them and they like me and i like them but i saved historically black colleges and universities but why didn t he do it four years ago why didn t you do that four years ago even less than that why didn t you when you vice president you keep talking about all these things you re going to do and you re going to do this but you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing you know joe i ran because of you i ran because of barack obama because you did a poor job if i thought you did a good job i would ve never run i would ve never run i ran because of you i m looking at you now you re a politician i ran because of you excuse me if this stuff is true about russia ukraine china other countries iraq if this is true then he s a corrupt politician so don t give me the stuff about how you re this innocent baby joe that calling you a corrupt politician they re calling it the laptop from hell excuse me crosstalk the laptop from hell you mean the laptop is now another russia russia russia hoax you got to be kidding me this is where he s going the laptop is russia russia russia you have to be kidding here we go again with the russia boy oh boy can t believe that one well you have to understand the first time i ever heard of black lives matter they were chanting pigs in a blanket talking about police pigs pigs talking about our police pigs in a blanket fry them like bacon i said that s a horrible thing and they were marching down the street and that was my first glimpse of black lives matter i thought it was a terrible thing as far as my relationships with all people i think i have great relationships with all people i am the least racist person in this room i don t know i mean i don t know what to say i got criminal justice reform done and prison reform and opportunity zones got criminal justice reform done and prison reform and opportunity zones i took care of black colleges and universities i don t know what to say they can say anything i mean they can say anything it s a very makes me sad because i am the least racist person i can t even see the audience because it s so dark but i don t care who s in the audience i m the least racist person in this room no he made a reference to abraham lincoln where did that come in i mean where did that no i said not since abraham lincoln has anybody done what i ve done for the black community i didn t say i m abraham lincoln i said not since abraham lincoln has anybody done what i ve done for the black community now you have done nothing other than the crime bill which put tens of thousands of black men mostly in jail and you know what they remember it because if you look at what s happening with the voting right now they remember that you treated them very very badly just take a look at what s happening out there but why didn t he get it done see it s all talk no action with these politicians why didn t he get it that s what i m going to do when i become president you were vice president along with obama as your president your leader for eight years why didn t you get it done you had eight years to get it done now you re saying you re going to get it done because you re all talking and no action joe you didn t get anything done you got nothing done i just have one question why didn t you do it in the eight years a short time ago why didn t you do it you just said i m going to do that i m going to do this you put tens of thousands of mostly black young men in prison now you re saying you re going to get you re going to undo that why didn t you get it done you had eight years with obama you know why joe because you re all talk and no action well you got to talk them into it joe sometimes you got to talk them into it like i did with criminal justice reform i had to talk democrats into it so we have the trillion trees program we have so many different programs i do love the environment but what i want is that cleanest crystal clear water the cleanest air we have the best lowest number in carbon emissions which is a big standard that i noticed obama goes with all the time not joe i haven t heard joe use the term because i m not sure he knows what it represents or means but i have heard obama use it and we have the best carbon emission numbers that we ve had in years under this administration we are working so well with industry but here s what we can t do look at china how filthy it is look at russia look at india it s filthy the air is filthy the paris accord i took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly when they put us in there they did us a great disservice they were going to take away our businesses i will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs thousands and thousands of companies because of the paris accord it was so unfair china doesn t kick in until russia goes back to a low standard and we kicked in right away it would have been it would have destroyed our businesses so you ready we have done an incredible job environmentally we have the cleanest air the cleanest water and the best carbon emission standards that we ve seen in many many years and we haven t destroyed our industries they came out and said very strongly will be taken away from families under his plan that his plan is an economic disaster if you look at what he wants to do if you look at his plan his his environmental plan do you know developed it aoc plus three they know nothing about the climate i mean she s got a good line of stuff but she knows nothing about the climate and they re all hopping through hoops for aoc plus three look their real plan cost a hundred trillion dollars if we had the best year in the history of our country for a hundred years we would not even come close to a number like that when he says buildings they want to take buildings down because they want to make bigger windows into smaller windows as far as they re concerned if you had no window it would be a lovely thing this is the craziest plan that anybody has ever seen and this wasn t done by smart people this wasn t done by anybody frankly i don t even know how it can be good politically they want to spend a hundred trillion dollars that s their real number he s trying to say it was six it s a hundred trillion dollars they want to knock down buildings and build new buildings with little tiny small windows and many other things and many other things and many other things it is crazy you ll destroy our country excuse me we are energy independent for first time we don t need all of these countries that we had to fight war over because we needed their energy we are energy independent i know more about wind than you do it s extremely expensive kills all the birds it s very intermittent it s got a lot of problems and they happen to make the windmills in both germany and china and the fumes coming up if you re a believer in carbon emission the fumes coming up to make these massive windmills is more than anything that we re talking about with natural gas which is very clear one other thing solar i love solar but solar doesn t quite have it yet it s not powerful yet to really run our big beautiful factories that we need to compete with the world it s all a pipe dream but you know what we ll do we re going to have the greatest economy in the world but if you want to kill the economy get rid of your oil industry you want and what about fracking now we have to ask him about fracking you said it on tape i ll put it on excuse me he was against fracking he said it i will show that to you tomorrow i am against fracking until he got the nomination he went to pennsylvania then he said but you know what pennsylvania he ll be against it very soon because his party is totally against it the families that we re talking about are employed heavily and they are making a lot of money more money than they ve ever made if you look at the kind of numbers that we ve produced for hispanic for black for asian it s nine times greater the percentage gain than it was under in three years than it was under eight years of the two of them to put it nicely nine times more now somebody lives i have not heard the numbers or the statistics that you re saying but they re making a tremendous amount of money economically we saved it and i saved it again a number of months ago when oil was crashing because of the pandemic we saved it say what you want to bet relationship we got saudi arabia mexico and russia to cut back way back we saved our oil industry and now it s very vibrant again and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline remember that would he close down the oil industry would you close dow the oil industry oh that s a big statement that s a big statement oh i see okay that s a big statement yeah we actually give it to solar and wind that s maybe the biggest statement in terms of business that s the biggest statement because basically what he s saying is he is going to destroy the oil industry will you remember that texas will you remember that pennsylvania oklahoma remember that pennsylvania oklahoma is ohio is he going to get china to do it is he going to get china to do it crosstalk we have to make our country totally successful as it was prior to the plague coming in from china now we re rebuilding it and we re doing record numbers million jobs in a short period of time et cetera but i will tell you go back before the plague came in just before i was getting calls from people that were not normally people that would call me they wanted to get together we had the best black unemployment numbers in the history of our country hispanic women asian people with diplomas with no diplomas mit graduates number one in the class everybody had the best numbers and you know what the other side wanted to get together they wanted to unify success is going to bring us together we are on the road to success but i m cutting taxes and he wants to raise everybody s taxes and he wants to put new regulations on everything he will kill it if he gets in you will have a depression the likes of which you ve never seen your k s will go to hell and it ll be a very very sad day for this country

Americans dead. You hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this. Anyone who is responsible for not taking control. In fact, not saying I take no responsibility initially. Anyone is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as president of the United States of America. We’re in a situation where there are a thousand deaths a day now. A thousand deaths a day. And there are over 70,000 new cases per day. Compared to what’s going on in Europe as the New England Medical Journal said, they’re starting from a very low rate. We’re starting from a very high rate., The expectation is we’ll have another 200,000 Americans dead between now and the end of the year. If we just wore these masks, the president’s own advisors have told him, we can save a 100,000 lives. And we’re in a circumstance where the president thus far and still has no plan, no comprehensive plan., What I would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask all the time. I would make sure we move into the direction of rapid testing, investing in rapid testing. I would make sure that we set up national standards as to how to open up schools and open up businesses so they can be safe and give them the wherewithal, the financial resources to be able to do that., We’re in a situation now where the New England Medical Journal, one of the serious, most serious journals in the whole world said for the first time ever that the way this president has responded to this crisis has been absolutely tragic. And so folks, I will take care of this. I will end this. I will make sure we have a plan., Make sure it’s totally transparent. Have the scientists of the world see it, know it, look at it, go through all the processes. And by the way, this is the same fellow who told you, “This is going to end by Easter” last time. This is the same fellow who told you that, “Don’t worry, we’re going to end this by the summer.” We’re about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter and he has no clear plan. And there’s no prospect that there’s going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the American people before the middle of next year., My response is he is xenophobic, but not because he shutdown access from China. And he did it late after 40 countries had already done that. In addition to that, what he did, he made sure that we had 44 people that were in there in China trying to get the Wuhan to determine what exactly the source was. What did the president say in January? He said, ” No.” He said, “He’s being transparent. The president of China is being transparent. We owe him a debt of gratitude. We have to thank him.”, And then what happened was we started talking about using the Defense Act to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people. And again, I go back to this. He had nothing, he did virtually nothing. And then he gets out of the hospital and he talks about, “Oh, don’t worry. It’s all going to be over soon.” Come on. There’s not another serious scientist in the world who thinks it’s going to be over soon., I didn’t say over soon. I say we’re learning to live with it. We have no choice. We can’t lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does. He has the ability to lock himself up. I don’t know. He’s obviously made a lot of money someplace, but he has this thing about living in a basement. People can’t do that. By the way I as the president couldn’t do that. I’d love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the White House and go away for a year and a half until it disappears. I can’t do that., And Kirsten, every meeting I had, every meeting I had and I’d meet a lot of families, including gold star families and military families. Every meeting I had and I had to meet them, I had to. It would be horrible to have canceled everything. I said, “This is dangerous and you catch it.” And I caught it. I learned a lot. I learned a lot. Great doctors, great hospitals. And now I recovered. 99.9 of young people recover. 99% of people recover. We have to recover-, Can I respond to that?, Number one, he says that we’re learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it. You folks home will have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning. That man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch, there out of habit, where their wife or husband was, is gone. Learning to live with it. Come on. We’re dying with it, because he’s never said. See, you said, “It’s dangerous.” When’s the last time? Is it really dangerous still? Are we dangerous. You tell the people it’s dangerous now. What should they do about the danger? And you say, “I take no responsibility.”, The fact is that when we knew it was coming, when it hit, what happened? What did the President say? He said, “Don’t worry. It’s going to go away. It’ll be gone by Easter. Don’t worry. Warm weather. Don’t worry. Maybe inject bleach.” He said he was kidding when he said that, but a lot of people thought it was serious. A whole range of things the President has said, even today, he thinks we are in control. We’re about to lose 200,000 more people., I didn’t say either of those things., I talked about his xenophobia in a different context. It wasn’t about closing the border to Chinese coming to the United States., No., What I would say is, I’m going to shut down the virus, not the country. It’s his ineptitude that caused the country to have to shut down in large part, why businesses have gone under, why schools are closed, why so many people have lost their living, and why they’re concerned. Those other concerns are real. That’s why he should have been, instead of in a sand trap at his golf course, he should have been negotiating with Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the Democrats and Republicans about what to do about the acts they were passing for billions of dollars to make sure people had the capacity., Oh, well, no. I’m not shutting down today, but there are … Look, you need standards. The standard is, if you have a reproduction rate in a community that’s above a certain level, everybody says, “Slow up. More social distancing. Do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums. Do not open until you get this under control, under more control.” But when you do open, give the people the capacity to be able to open and have the capacity to do it safely. For example, schools. Schools, they need a lot of money to be open. They need to deal with ventilation systems. They need to deal with smaller classes, more teachers, more pods, and he’s refused to support that money, or at least up to now., Simply not true. We ought to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. We ought to be able to safely open, but they need resources to open? You need to be able to, for example, if you’re going to open a business, have social distancing within the business. You need to have, if you have a restaurant, you need to have plexiglass dividers so people cannot infect one another. You need to be in a position where you can take testing rapidly and know whether the person is in fact infected. You need to be able to trace. You need to be able to provide all the resources that are needed to do this. And that is not inconsistent with saying that we’re going to make sure that we’re going to open safely. And by the way, all you teachers out there, not that many of you are going to die, so don’t worry about it. So don’t worry about it. Come on., Take a look at what New York has done in terms of turning the curve down, in terms of the number of people dying. And I don’t look at this in terms of the way he does, blue states and red states. They’re all the United States. And look at the states that are having such a spike in the coronavirus. They’re the red states, they’re the states in the Midwest, they’re the states in the upper Midwest. That’s where the spike is occurring significantly. But they’re all Americans. They’re all Americans. And what we have to do is say, wear these masks, number one. Make sure we get the help that the businesses need. That money’s already been passed to do that. It’s been out there since the beginning of the summer, and nothing’s happened., My response is that think about what the President knew in January and didn’t tell the American people. He was told this was a serious virus that spread in the air, and it was much worse, much worse, than the flu. He went on record and said to one of your colleagues, recorded, that in fact he knew how dangerous it was but he didn’t want to tell us. He didn’t want to tell us because he didn’t want us to panic. He didn’t want us… Americans don’t panic. He panicked. But guess what, in the meantime, we find out in the New York Times the other day, that in fact his folks went to Wall Street and said, “This is a really dangerous thing.” And a memo out of that meeting — not from his administration, but from some of the brokers — said, “Sell short, because we’ve got to get moving. It’s a dangerous problem.”, I haven’t-, Average contribution, $43., I made it clear and I asked everyone else to take the pledge. I made it clear that any country, no matter who it is, that interferes in American elections will pay a price. They will pay a price. And it’s been overwhelmingly clear this election — I won’t even get into the last one — this election, that Russia has been involved, China’s been involved to some degree, and now we learn that Iran is involved. They will pay a price if I’m elected. They’re interfering with American sovereignty. That’s what’s going on right now. They’re interfering with American sovereignty., And to the best of my knowledge, I don’t think the President has said anything to Putin about it. I don’t think he’s talking to them a lot. I don’t think he’s said a word. I don’t know why he hasn’t said a word to Putin about it, and I don’t know what he has recently said, if anything, to the Iranians. My guess is he’d probably be more outspoken with regard to the Iranians., But the point is this, folks. We are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election. His own National Security Advisor told him that what is happening with his buddy… Well, I shouldn’t… Well, I will. His buddy Rudy Giuliani. He’s being used as a Russian pawn. He’s being fed information that is Russian that is not true. And then what happens? Nothing happens. And then you find out that everything that’s going on here, about Russia is wanting to make sure that I do not get elected the next President of the United States, because they know I know them, and they know me., I don’t understand why this President is unwilling to take on Putin when he’s actually paying bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan, when he’s engaged in activities that are trying to destabilize all of NATO. I don’t know why he doesn’t do it, but it’s worth asking the question. Why isn’t that being done? Any country that interferes with us will, in fact, pay a price, because they’re affecting our sovereignty., [crosstalk 00:01:31]., I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life. We learned that this president paid 50 times the tax in China as a secret bank account with China, does business in China, and in fact, is talking about me taking money? I have not taken a single penny from any country, whatsoever, ever, number one., Number two, this is a president… I have released all of my tax returns, 22 years, go look at them, 22 years of my tax return. You have not released a single solitary year of your tax return. What are you hiding? Why are you unwilling? The foreign countries are paying you a lot. Russia’s paying you a lot. China’s paying you a lot on your hotels and all your businesses all around the country, all around the world. And China’s building a new road to a new golf course you have overseas. So, what’s going on here? Release your tax return or stop talking about corruption., I have to respond to that., Why did he… he’s been saying this for four years, show us, just show us, stop playing around. You’ve been saying for four years you’re going to release your taxes., Nobody knows, Mr. President. What they do know is you’re not paying your taxes, or you’re paying taxes that are so low, when last time he said, what he paid, he said, I only pay that little because I’m smart. I know how to game the system. Come on. Come on, folks., Sure., Nothing was unethical. Here’s what the deal. With regard to Ukraine. We had this whole question about whether or not, because he was on the board, I later learned of Burisma, a company that somehow, I had done something wrong, yet every single solitary person, when he was going through his impeachment, testifying under oath, who work for him, said I did my job impeccably. I carried out U.S. policy, not one single solitary thing was out of line, not a single thing, number one., Number two, the guy who got in trouble in Ukraine was this guy trying to bribe the Ukrainian government to say something negative about me, which they would not do and did not do because it never ever, ever happened. My son has not made money in terms of this thing about, what are you talking about, China. I have not had… the only guy who made money from China is this guy. He’s the only one. Nobody else has made money from China., No basis for that. Everybody investigated that. No one said anything he did was wrong in Ukraine., Not true., What I’d make China do is play by the international rules, not like he has done. He has caused the deficit of the China to go up, not down, with China, up, not down. We are making sure that in order to do business in China, you have to give all your intellectual property. You have to have a partner in China. It’s 51%, we would not do that at all, number one., Number two, we’re in a situation where China would have to play by the rules internationally as well. When I met with Xi and when I was still vice-president, he said we’re setting up air identification zones in the South China Sea. You can’t fly through them. I said we’re going to fly through them. We just flew B-52, B-1 bombers through it. We’re not going to pay attention. They have to play by the rules. And what’s he do? He embraces guys like the thugs, like in North Korea and the Chinese president and Putin and others, and he pokes his finger [inaudible 00:10:36] all of our friends, all of our allies. We make up only… we’re 25%, 25% of the world’s economy. We need to be having the rest of our friends with us saying to China, “These are the rules. You play by them, or you’re going to pay the price for not paying by them economically.”, That’s the way I will run it, and that’s what we did and upholding steel tariffs and a range of other things when we were president and vice-president., … and Vice President., Not true., That’s not true., Tax payer’s money., Taxpayer’s money. Didn’t come from China., Not true., My response is, look, there’s a reason why he’s bringing up all this malarkey. There’s a reason for it. He doesn’t want to talk about the substantive issues. It’s not about his family and my family. It’s about your family, and your family’s hurting badly. If you’re a middle-class family, you’re getting hurt badly right now. You’re sitting at the kitchen table this morning deciding, “Well, we can’t get new tires. They’re bald, because we have to wait another month or so.” Or, “Are we going to be able to pay the mortgage?” Or, “Who’s going to tell her she can’t go back to community college?” They’re the decisions you’re making, and the middle-class families like I grew up in Scranton and Claymont, they’re in trouble. We should be talking about your families, but that’s the last thing he wants to talk about., I want to talk about North Korea., Because I’d make it clear, which we were making clear to China, they had to be part of the deal, because I made it clear as a spokesperson for the illustration when I went to China that I said, “Why are you moving your missile defense up so close? Why are you moving more forces here? Why are you continue to do military maneuvers with South Korea?” I said, “Because North Korea is a problem, and we’re going to continue to do it so we can control them. We’re going to make sure we can control them and make sure they can not hurt us. And so if you want to do something about it, step up and help. If not, it’s going to continue.” What has he done? He’s legitimized North Korea. He’s talked about his good buddy, who’s a thug, a thug. And he talks about how we’re better off. And they have much more capable missiles, able to reach us territory much more easily than they ever did before., On the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity. The Korean Peninsula should be a nuclear free zone., We had a good relationship with Hitler before he, in fact, invaded Europe, the rest of Europe. Come on. The reason he would not meet with President Obama is because President Obama said, “We’re going to talk about denuclearization. We’re not going to legitimize you and we’re going to continue to push stronger and stronger sanctions on you.” That’s why he wouldn’t meet with us., What I’m going to do is pass Obamacare with a public option, and become Bidencare. The public option is an option that says that if you in fact do not have the wherewithal, if you qualify for Medicaid and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get Medicaid, you automatically are enrolled, providing competition for insurance companies. That’s what’s going to happen. Secondly, we’re going to make sure we reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that there’s competition, that doesn’t exist now, by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies. Thirdly, the idea that I want to eliminate private insurance, the reason why I had such a fight with 20 candidates for the nomination was I support private insurance. That’s why. Not one single person with private insurance would lose their insurance under my plan, nor did they under Obamacare. They did not lose their insurance unless they chose they wanted to go to something else., Lastly, we’re going to make sure we’re in a situation that we actually protect pre-existing. There’s no way he can protect pre-existing conditions. None, zero. You can’t do it in the ether. He’s been talking about this for a long time. He’s never come up with a plan. I guess we’re going to get the pre-existing condition plan the same time we got the infrastructure plan that we waited for since ’17, ’18, ’19, and 20. I still have a few more minutes. I know you’re getting anxious. The fact is that he’s already cost the American people, because of his terrible handling of the COVID virus and economic spillover. 10 million people have lost their private insurance, and he wants to take away 22 million more people who have it under Obamacare and over 110 million people with pre-existing conditions. And all the people from COVID are going to have pre-existing conditions, what are they going to do?, I say it’s ridiculous. It’s like saying that the fact that there’s a public option that people can choose, that makes it a socialist plan. Look, the difference between the president and I… I think healthcare is not a privilege, it’s a right. Everyone should have the right to have affordable healthcare, and I am very proud of my plan. It’s gotten endorsed by all the major labor unions, as well as a whole range of other people who, in fact, are concerned in the medical field. This is something that’s going to save people’s lives. And this is going to give some people an opportunity to have healthcare for their children. How many of you at home are worried and rolling around in bed tonight, wondering what in God’s name you’re going to do if you get sick, because you’ve lost your health insurance and your company’s gone under? We have to provide health insurance for people at an affordable rate, and that’s what I do., By the way-, You can ask it., I have to respond to healthcare., My response is, people deserve to have affordable healthcare, period. Period, period, period. And the Biden care proposal will in fact provide for that affordable healthcare, lower premiums. What we’re going to do is going to cost some money. It’s going to cost over $750 billion over 10 years to do it. And they’re going to have lower premiums. You can buy into the better plans, the cheaper plans, lower your premiums, deal with unexpected billing, and have your drug prices drop significantly. He keeps talking about it. He hasn’t done a thing for anybody on healthcare. Not a thing., Wrong., Bernie., He’s a very confused guy. He thinks he’s running against somebody else. He’s running against Joe Biden. I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them. Joe Biden, he’s running against. And the idea that we’re in a situation that is going to destroy Medicare… This is the guy that the actuary of Medicare said, “If in fact…” That’s Social Security. “If in fact he continues his plan to withhold the tax on Social Security, Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023 with no way to make up for it.” This is the guy who’s tried to cut Medicare. The idea that Donald Trump is lecturing me on Social Security and Medicare? Come on., May I respond?, Look, the idea that the stock market is booming is his only measure of what’s happening. Where I come from in Scranton and Claymont, the people don’t live off of the stock market. Just in the last three years, during this crisis, the billionaires in this country made, according to Wall Street, 700 billion more dollars. 700 billion more dollars. Because that’s his only measure. What happens to the ordinary people out there? What happens to them?, By the way, as you know, the Republican leader in the United States Senate said he can’t pass it. He will be able to pass it. He does not have Republican votes. Why isn’t he talking to his Republican friends?, I have, and they have pushed it. Look, they passed this act all the way back in the beginning of the summer. It’s not new. It’s been out there. This HEROES Act has been sitting there. And look at what’s happening. When I was in charge of the recovery act with $800 billion, I was able to get $145 billion to local communities that have to balance their budgets and states that have to balance their budgets. And then they have to fire firefighters, teachers, first responders, law enforcement officers, so they could keep their cities and counties running. He will not support that. They have not done a thing for them. And Mitch McConnell said, “Let them go bankrupt. Let them go bankrupt.” Come on. What’s the matter with these guys?, By the way, if I get elected, I’m not going to… I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’m going to be an American president. I don’t see red states and blue states. What I see is American United States. And folks, every single state out there finds themself in trouble. They’re going to start laying off, whether they’re red or blue, cops, firefighters, first responders, teachers, because they have to balance their budget. And the founders were smart. They allowed the federal government to deficit spend to compensate for the United States of America., I do, because I think one of the things we’re going to have to do is we’re going to have to bail them out too. We should be bailing them out now, those small businesses. You got one in six of them going under. They’re not going to be able to make it back. They passed a package that allows us to be able… They call it PPP. Money is supposed to go to help them do everything from organize how they can deal with their businesses being open safely, schools, how they can make classrooms smaller, how they can hire more teachers, how they can put ventilation systems in. They need the help. The businesses, as well as the schools, need the help. These guys will not help them. It’s not giving them any of the money., Not true, by the way., Every-, No one should work one job, be below poverty. People are making six, seven, eight bucks an hour. These first responders we all clap for as they come down the street because they’ve allowed us to make it. What’s happening? They deserve a minimum wage of $15. Anything below that puts you below the poverty level. And there is no evidence that when you raise the minimum wage, businesses go out of business. That is simply not true., It’s an [crosstalk 00:32:35]-, These 500-plus kids came with parents. They separated them at the border to make it a disincentive to come to begin with. “Be real tough. We’re really strong.” And guess what? They cannot… Coyotes didn’t bring them over. Their parents were with them. They got separated from their parents. And it makes us a laughingstock and violates every notion of who we are as a nation., We did not separate the [crosstalk 00:34:25]-, Let’s talk about what we’re talking about., Let’s talk about what we’re talking about. What happened? Parents were ripped… Their kids were ripped from their arms and separated, and now they cannot find over 500 of the sets of those parents, and those kids are alone. Nowhere to go. Nowhere to go. It’s criminal. It’s criminal., Because we made a mistake made. It took too long to get it right. Took too long to get it right. I’ll be President of the United States, not Vice President of the United States. And the fact is I’ve made it very clear. Within a 100 days, I’m going to send to the United States Congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people. And all of those so-called dreamers, those DACA kids, they’re going to be immediately certified again to be able to stay in this country and put on a path to citizenship. The idea that they are being sent home by this guy and they want to do that is they’ve gone to they’ve never seen before. I can imagine. You’re five years old. Your parents are taking across the Rio Grande River and it’s illegal. And you say, “Oh, no, Mom. Leave me here. I’m not going to go with you.” They been here. Many of them are model citizens. Over 20,000 of them are first responders out there taking care of people during this crisis. We owe them. We owe them., The catch and release, you know what he’s talking about there? If in fact you had a family came across and they were arrested, they in fact were given a date to show up for their hearing. They were released. And guess what? They showed up for a hearing. And this is the first President in the history of the United States of America that anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country. That’s never happened before in America. That’s never happened before in America. You come to the United States and you make your case that, “I seek asylum based on the following premise, why I deserve it under American law.” They’re sitting in squalor on the other side of the river., Know the law, what he’s telling you is simply not true. Check it out., Check it out., That’s right. And you 525 kids not knowing where in God’s name they’re going to be and lost their parents., I do. I do. My daughter is a social worker and she’s written a lot about this. She has her graduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in social work. And one of the reasons why I ended up working on the East Side of Wilmington, Delaware, which is 90% African-American, was to learn more about what was going on. I never had to tell my daughter if she’s pulled over, make sure she puts… For a traffic stop. “Put both hands on top of the wheel and don’t reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you.” But a Black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child, “When you’re walking down the street, don’t have a hoodie on when you go across the street., Making sure that you, in fact, if you get pulled over just, yes, sir, no, sir. Hands on top of the wheel. Because you are in fact, the victim, whether you’re a person making 300,000 … child of a $300,000 a year person or someone who’s on food stamps. The fact of the matter is, there is institutional racism in America. And we have always said, we’ve never lived up to it, that we hold these truths to be self-evident, all men and women are created equal. Well, guess what, we have never, ever lived up to it. But we’ve always constantly been moving the needle further and further to inclusion, not exclusion. This is the first president to come along and says, that’s the end of that. We’re not going to do that anymore. We have to provide for economic opportunity, better education, better healthcare, better access to schooling, better access to opportunity to borrow money to start businesses, all the things we can do. And I’ve laid out a clear plan as to how to do those things just to give people a shot. It’s about accumulating the ability to have wealth as well as it is to be free from violence., My response to that is I never ever said what he accused me of saying. The fact of the matter is in 2000 though, after the crime bill had been in the law for awhile, this is a guy who said, “The problem with the crime bill, there’s not enough people in jail. There’s not enough people in jail.” And go on my website, get the quote, the date when he said it, “not enough people.” He talked about marauding gangs, young gangs, and the people who are going to maraud our cities. This is a guy who in the Central Park Five, five innocent black kids, he continued to push for making sure that they got the death penalty. None of them were guilty of the crimes they were suggested. Look and granted, he did in fact, let 20 people … he commuted 20 people’s sentences., We commuted over 1,000 people’s sentences, over 1,000. The very law he’s talking about is a law that in fact, initiated by Barack Obama. And secondly, we’re in a situation here where the federal prison system was reduced by 38,000 people under our administration. And one of those things we should be doing, there should be no, no minimum mandatories in the law. That’s why I’m offering $20 billion to states to change their state laws to eliminate minimum mandatories and set up drug courts. No one should be going to jail because they have a drug problem. They should be going to rehabilitation, not to jail. We should fundamentally change the system and that’s what I’m going to do., We did-, Well, I’ll tell you what I hope he does look at me because what’s happening here is, you know who I am. You know who he is, you know his character, you know my character, you know our reputations for honor and telling the truth. I am anxious to have this race. I’m anxious to see this take place. I am … The character of the country is on the ballot. Our character’s on the ballot, look at us closely., Nobody’s calling me-, Nobody., I have to respond to that. Because look-, There are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what he’s accusing me of is a Russian plant. They have said that this has all the … five former heads of the CIA, both parties, say what he’s saying is a bunch of garbage. Nobody believes it except him and his good friend, Rudy Giuliani., That’s exactly what was told., Abraham Lincoln here is one of the most racist presidents we’ve had in modern history, he pours fuel on every single racist fire, every single one. Started off his campaign coming down the escalator saying he’s getting rid of those Mexican rapists, he’s ban Muslims because they’re Muslims, he has moved around and made everything worse across the board. He says to… About the Proud Boys, last time we were on stage here he said, “I tell them to stand down and stand ready.” Come on, this guy has a dog whistle about as big as a foghorn., You said you’re Abraham Lincoln., You said-, And I’m saying-, Oh, God., Not true., One of the things is that in the ’80s we passed 100 percent, all 100 senators voted for a bill on drugs and how to deal with drugs, it was a mistake. I’ve been trying to change since then particularly the portion on cocaine. That’s why I’ve been arguing that in fact we should not send anyone to jail for a pure drug offense, they should be going into treatment across the board, that’s what we should be spending money. And that’s why I set up drug courts which were never funded by our Republican friends. They should not be going to jail for a drug or an alcohol problem, they should be going into treatment. That’s what we’ve been trying to do, that’s what I’m going to get done because I think the American people have now seen that in fact it was a mistake to pass those laws relating to drugs, but they were not in the Crime Bill., We got a lot of it done. We released 38,000-, We got 38,000 prisoners [ crosstalk 00:11:30]-, 38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison, we have… There were over a thousand people who were given clemency. [inaudible 00:03:38]. In fact, were the ones that put in the legislation saying we could look at pattern and practice of police departments and what they were doing, how they’re conducting themselves. I could go on, but we began the process, we lost an election, that’s why I’m running to win back that election and change his terrible policy., [crosstalk 00:00:12:23]., We had a Republican Congress, that’s the answer., You did what we already had done., Climate change, global warming is an existential threat to humanity. We have a moral obligation to deal with it. And we’re told by all the leading scientists in the world we don’t have much time, we’re going to pass the point of no return within the next 8 to 10 years. Four more years of this man eliminating all the regulations that were put in by us to clean up the climate, to clean up… To limit the emissions, will put us in a position where we’re going to be in real trouble. Here’s where we have a great opportunity. I was able to get both all the environmental organizations as well as the labor, the people worried about jobs, to support my climate plan., Because what it does, it will create millions of new good paying jobs, we’re going to invest in, for example, 500,000… Excuse me, 50,000 charging stations on our highways so that we can own the electric car market of the future. In the meantime, China is doing that. We’re going to be in a position where we’re going to see to it that we’re going to take 4 million existing buildings and 2 million existing homes and retrofit them so they don’t leak as much energy, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of…, So they don’t leak as much energy saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the process and creating significant number of jobs. By the way, the whole idea of what this is all going to do, it’s going to create millions of jobs and it’s going to clean the environment. Our health and our jobs are at stake. That’s what’s happening and what right now, by the way, Wall Street firms indicated that my plan, my plan will in fact, create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more than his. This is from Wall Street and I’ll create $1 trillion more in economic growth than his proposal does. Not on climate, just on economy., [crosstalk 00:16:56]., I don’t know where he comes from. I don’t know where he comes up with these numbers., A hundred trillion dollars, give me a break. This plan has been endorsed by every major, every major environmental group and every labor group, labor, because they know the future lies. The future lies in us being able to breathe and they know they’re good jobs and getting us there., By the way, the fastest growing industry in America is the electric, excuse me, solar energy and wind. He thinks wind causes cancer, windmills. It’s the fastest growing jobs and they pay good prevailing wages, 45, 50 bucks an hour. We can grow and we can be cleaner if we go the route I’m proposing., Find me a scientist who says that., False., I never said I oppose fracking., Show the tape, put it on your website., Put it on the website. The fact of the matter is he’s flat lying., I do rule out banning fracking because the answer we need, we need other industries to transition, to get to ultimately a complete zero emissions by 2025. What I will do with fracking over time is make sure that we can capture the emissions from the fracking, capture the emissions from gas. We can do that and we can do that by investing money in doing it, but it’s a transition to that., Good., Fracking on federal land. I said, no fracking and/or oil on federal land., My response is that those people live on what they call fence lines. He doesn’t understand this. They live near chemical plants that in fact, pollute, chemical plants and oil plants and refineries that pollute., I used to live near that when I was growing up in Claymont, Delaware and there are more oil refineries in Marcus Hook and the Delaware River than there is any place, including in Houston at the time. When my mom get in the car and when there are first frost to drive me to school, turning the windshield wiper, there’d been oil slick in the window. That’s why so many people in my state were dying and getting cancer. The fact is those frontline communities, it’s not a matter of what you’re paying them. It matters how you keep them safe. What do you do? You impose restrictions on the pollutions that if the pollutants coming out of those fence line communities., By the way, I have a transition from the old industry, yes., I will transition. It is a big statement., Because I would stop., Because the oil industry pollutes, significantly., Here’s the deal-, Well if you let me finish the statement, because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time, over time, and I’d stopped giving to the oil industry, I’d stop giving them federal subsidies. You won’t get federal subsidies to the gas, oh, excuse me to solar and wind., Why are we giving it to oil industry?, He takes everything out of context, but the point is, look, we have to move toward net zero emissions. The first place to do that by the year 2035 is in energy production, by 2050 totally., No, I’m going to rejoin Paris Accord and make China abide by what they agreed to., I will say, I’m an American President. I represent all of you, whether you voted for me or against me, and I’m going to make sure that you’re represented. I’m going to give you hope. We’re going to move; we’re going to choose science over fiction. We’re going to choose hope over fear. We’re going to choose to move forward because we have enormous opportunities, enormous opportunities to make things better., We can grow this economy, we can deal with the systemic racism. At the same time, we can make sure that our economy is being run and moved and motivated by clean energy, creating millions of new jobs. That’s the fact, that’s what we’re going to do. And I’m going to say, as I said at the beginning, what is on the ballot here is the character of this country. Decency, honor, respect. Treating people with dignity, making sure that everyone has an even chance. And I’m going to make sure you get that. You haven’t been getting it the last four years., Thank you.'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":41}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZA-uaZLBPNAm"},"source":["#### Pre-processing

dead you hear nothing else i say tonight hear this anyone who is responsible for not taking control in fact not saying i take no responsibility initially anyone is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as president of the united states of america we re in a situation where there are a thousand deaths a day now a thousand deaths a day and there are over new cases per day compared to what s going on in europe as the new england medical journal said they re starting from a very low rate we re starting from a very high rate the expectation is we ll have another americans dead between now and the end of the year if we just wore these masks the president s own advisors have told him we can save a lives and we re in a circumstance where the president thus far and still has no plan no comprehensive plan what i would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask all the time i would make sure we move into the direction of rapid testing investing in rapid testing i would make sure that we set up national standards as to how to open up schools and open up businesses so they can be safe and give them the wherewithal the financial resources to be able to do that we re in a situation now where the new england medical journal one of the serious most serious journals in the whole world said for the first time ever that the way this president has responded to this crisis has been absolutely tragic and so folks i will take care of this i will end this i will make sure we have a plan make sure it s totally transparent have the scientists of the world see it know it look at it go through all the processes and by the way this is the same fellow who told you this is going to end by easter last time this is the same fellow who told you that don t worry we re going to end this by the summer we re about to go into a dark winter a dark winter and he has no clear plan and there s no prospect that there s going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the american people before the middle of next year my response is he is xenophobic but not because he shutdown access from china and he did it late after countries had already done that in addition to that what he did he made sure that we had people that were in there in china trying to get the wuhan to determine what exactly the source was what did the president say in january he said no he said he s being transparent the president of china is being transparent we owe him a debt of gratitude we have to thank him and then what happened was we started talking about using the defense act to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people and again i go back to this he had nothing he did virtually nothing and then he gets out of the hospital and he talks about oh don t worry it s all going to be over soon come on there s not another serious scientist in the world who thinks it s going to be over soon i didn t say over soon i say we re learning to live with it we have no choice we can t lock ourselves up in a basement like joe does he has the ability to lock himself up i don t know he s obviously made a lot of money someplace but he has this thing about living in a basement people can t do that by the way i as the president couldn t do that i d love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the white house and go away for a year and a half until it disappears i can t do that and kirsten every meeting i had every meeting i had and i d meet a lot of families including gold star families and military families every meeting i had and i had to meet them i had to it would be horrible to have canceled everything i said this is dangerous and you catch it and i caught it i learned a lot i learned a lot great doctors great hospitals and now i recovered of young people recover of people recover we have to recover can i respond to that number one he says that we re learning to live with it people are learning to die with it you folks home will have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning that man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch there out of habit where their wife or husband was is gone learning to live with it come on we re dying with it because he s never said see you said it s dangerous when s the last time is it really dangerous still are we dangerous you tell the people it s dangerous now what should they do about the danger and you say i take no responsibility the fact is that when we knew it was coming when it hit what happened what did the president say he said don t worry it s going to go away it ll be gone by easter don t worry warm weather don t worry maybe inject bleach he said he was kidding when he said that but a lot of people thought it was serious a whole range of things the president has said even today he thinks we are in control we re about to lose more people i didn t say either of those things i talked about his xenophobia in a different context it wasn t about closing the border to chinese coming to the united states no what i would say is i m going to shut down the virus not the country it s his ineptitude that caused the country to have to shut down in large part why businesses have gone under why schools are closed why so many people have lost their living and why they re concerned those other concerns are real that s why he should have been instead of in a sand trap at his golf course he should have been negotiating with nancy pelosi and the rest of the democrats and republicans about what to do about the acts they were passing for billions of dollars to make sure people had the capacity oh well no i m not shutting down today but there are look you need standards the standard is if you have a reproduction rate in a community that s above a certain level everybody says slow up more social distancing do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums do not open until you get this under control under more control but when you do open give the people the capacity to be able to open and have the capacity to do it safely for example schools schools they need a lot of money to be open they need to deal with ventilation systems they need to deal with smaller classes more teachers more pods and he s refused to support that money or at least up to now simply not true we ought to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time we ought to be able to safely open but they need resources to open you need to be able to for example if you re going to open a business have social distancing within the business you need to have if you have a restaurant you need to have plexiglass dividers so people cannot infect one another you need to be in a position where you can take testing rapidly and know whether the person is in fact infected you need to be able to trace you need to be able to provide all the resources that are needed to do this and that is not inconsistent with saying that we re going to make sure that we re going to open safely and by the way all you teachers out there not that many of you are going to die so don t worry about it so don t worry about it come on take a look at what new york has done in terms of turning the curve down in terms of the number of people dying and i don t look at this in terms of the way he does blue states and red states they re all the united states and look at the states that are having such a spike in the coronavirus they re the red states they re the states in the midwest they re the states in the upper midwest that s where the spike is occurring significantly but they re all americans they re all americans and what we have to do is say wear these masks number one make sure we get the help that the businesses need that money s already been passed to do that it s been out there since the beginning of the summer and nothing s happened my response is that think about what the president knew in january and didn t tell the american people he was told this was a serious virus that spread in the air and it was much worse much worse than the flu he went on record and said to one of your colleagues recorded that in fact he knew how dangerous it was but he didn t want to tell us he didn t want to tell us because he didn t want us to panic he didn t want us americans don t panic he panicked but guess what in the meantime we find out in the new york times the other day that in fact his folks went to wall street and said this is a really dangerous thing and a memo out of that meeting not from his administration but from some of the brokers said sell short because we ve got to get moving it s a dangerous problem i haven t average contribution i made it clear and i asked everyone else to take the pledge i made it clear that any country no matter who it is that interferes in american elections will pay a price they will pay a price and it s been overwhelmingly clear this election i won t even get into the last one this election that russia has been involved china s been involved to some degree and now we learn that iran is involved they will pay a price if i m elected they re interfering with american sovereignty that s what s going on right now they re interfering with american sovereignty and to the best of my knowledge i don t think the president has said anything to putin about it i don t think he s talking to them a lot i don t think he s said a word i don t know why he hasn t said a word to putin about it and i don t know what he has recently said if anything to the iranians my guess is he d probably be more outspoken with regard to the iranians but the point is this folks we are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election his own national security advisor told him that what is happening with his buddy well i shouldn t well i will his buddy rudy giuliani he s being used as a russian pawn he s being fed information that is russian that is not true and then what happens nothing happens and then you find out that everything that s going on here about russia is wanting to make sure that i do not get elected the next president of the united states because they know i know them and they know me i don t understand why this president is unwilling to take on putin when he s actually paying bounties to kill american soldiers in afghanistan when he s engaged in activities that are trying to destabilize all of nato i don t know why he doesn t do it but it s worth asking the question why isn t that being done any country that interferes with us will in fact pay a price because they re affecting our sovereignty crosstalk i have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life we learned that this president paid times the tax in china as a secret bank account with china does business in china and in fact is talking about me taking money i have not taken a single penny from any country whatsoever ever number one number two this is a president i have released all of my tax returns years go look at them years of my tax return you have not released a single solitary year of your tax return what are you hiding why are you unwilling the foreign countries are paying you a lot russia s paying you a lot china s paying you a lot on your hotels and all your businesses all around the country all around the world and china s building a new road to a new golf course you have overseas so what s going on here release your tax return or stop talking about corruption i have to respond to that why did he he s been saying this for four years show us just show us stop playing around you ve been saying for four years you re going to release your taxes nobody knows mr president what they do know is you re not paying your taxes or you re paying taxes that are so low when last time he said what he paid he said i only pay that little because i m smart i know how to game the system come on come on folks sure nothing was unethical here s what the deal with regard to ukraine we had this whole question about whether or not because he was on the board i later learned of burisma a company that somehow i had done something wrong yet every single solitary person when he was going through his impeachment testifying under oath who work for him said i did my job impeccably i carried out u s policy not one single solitary thing was out of line not a single thing number one number two the guy who got in trouble in ukraine was this guy trying to bribe the ukrainian government to say something negative about me which they would not do and did not do because it never ever ever happened my son has not made money in terms of this thing about what are you talking about china i have not had the only guy who made money from china is this guy he s the only one nobody else has made money from china no basis for that everybody investigated that no one said anything he did was wrong in ukraine not true what i d make china do is play by the international rules not like he has done he has caused the deficit of the china to go up not down with china up not down we are making sure that in order to do business in china you have to give all your intellectual property you have to have a partner in china it s we would not do that at all number one number two we re in a situation where china would have to play by the rules internationally as well when i met with xi and when i was still vice president he said we re setting up air identification zones in the south china sea you can t fly through them i said we re going to fly through them we just flew b b bombers through it we re not going to pay attention they have to play by the rules and what s he do he embraces guys like the thugs like in north korea and the chinese president and putin and others and he pokes his finger inaudible all of our friends all of our allies we make up only we re of the world s economy we need to be having the rest of our friends with us saying to china these are the rules you play by them or you re going to pay the price for not paying by them economically that s the way i will run it and that s what we did and upholding steel tariffs and a range of other things when we were president and vice president and vice president not true that s not true tax payer s money taxpayer s money didn t come from china not true my response is look there s a reason why he s bringing up all this malarkey there s a reason for it he doesn t want to talk about the substantive issues it s not about his family and my family it s about your family and your family s hurting badly if you re a middle class family you re getting hurt badly right now you re sitting at the kitchen table this morning deciding well we can t get new tires they re bald because we have to wait another month or so or are we going to be able to pay the mortgage or who s going to tell her she can t go back to community college they re the decisions you re making and the middle class families like i grew up in scranton and claymont they re in trouble we should be talking about your families but that s the last thing he wants to talk about i want to talk about north korea because i d make it clear which we were making clear to china they had to be part of the deal because i made it clear as a spokesperson for the illustration when i went to china that i said why are you moving your missile defense up so close why are you moving more forces here why are you continue to do military maneuvers with south korea i said because north korea is a problem and we re going to continue to do it so we can control them we re going to make sure we can control them and make sure they can not hurt us and so if you want to do something about it step up and help if not it s going to continue what has he done he s legitimized north korea he s talked about his good buddy who s a thug a thug and he talks about how we re better off and they have much more capable missiles able to reach us territory much more easily than they ever did before on the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity the korean peninsula should be a nuclear free zone we had a good relationship with hitler before he in fact invaded europe the rest of europe come on the reason he would not meet with president obama is because president obama said we re going to talk about denuclearization we re not going to legitimize you and we re going to continue to push stronger and stronger sanctions on you that s why he wouldn t meet with us what i m going to do is pass obamacare with a public option and become bidencare the public option is an option that says that if you in fact do not have the wherewithal if you qualify for medicaid and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get medicaid you automatically are enrolled providing competition for insurance companies that s what s going to happen secondly we re going to make sure we reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that there s competition that doesn t exist now by allowing medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies thirdly the idea that i want to eliminate private insurance the reason why i had such a fight with candidates for the nomination was i support private insurance that s why not one single person with private insurance would lose their insurance under my plan nor did they under obamacare they did not lose their insurance unless they chose they wanted to go to something else lastly we re going to make sure we re in a situation that we actually protect pre existing there s no way he can protect pre existing conditions none zero you can t do it in the ether he s been talking about this for a long time he s never come up with a plan i guess we re going to get the pre existing condition plan the same time we got the infrastructure plan that we waited for since and i still have a few more minutes i know you re getting anxious the fact is that he s already cost the american people because of his terrible handling of the covid virus and economic spillover million people have lost their private insurance and he wants to take away million more people who have it under obamacare and over million people with pre existing conditions and all the people from covid are going to have pre existing conditions what are they going to do i say it s ridiculous it s like saying that the fact that there s a public option that people can choose that makes it a socialist plan look the difference between the president and i i think healthcare is not a privilege it s a right everyone should have the right to have affordable healthcare and i am very proud of my plan it s gotten endorsed by all the major labor unions as well as a whole range of other people who in fact are concerned in the medical field this is something that s going to save people s lives and this is going to give some people an opportunity to have healthcare for their children how many of you at home are worried and rolling around in bed tonight wondering what in god s name you re going to do if you get sick because you ve lost your health insurance and your company s gone under we have to provide health insurance for people at an affordable rate and that s what i do by the way you can ask it i have to respond to healthcare my response is people deserve to have affordable healthcare period period period period and the biden care proposal will in fact provide for that affordable healthcare lower premiums what we re going to do is going to cost some money it s going to cost over billion over years to do it and they re going to have lower premiums you can buy into the better plans the cheaper plans lower your premiums deal with unexpected billing and have your drug prices drop significantly he keeps talking about it he hasn t done a thing for anybody on healthcare not a thing wrong bernie he s a very confused guy he thinks he s running against somebody else he s running against joe biden i beat all those other people because i disagreed with them joe biden he s running against and the idea that we re in a situation that is going to destroy medicare this is the guy that the actuary of medicare said if in fact that s social security if in fact he continues his plan to withhold the tax on social security social security will be bankrupt by with no way to make up for it this is the guy who s tried to cut medicare the idea that donald trump is lecturing me on social security and medicare come on may i respond look the idea that the stock market is booming is his only measure of what s happening where i come from in scranton and claymont the people don t live off of the stock market just in the last three years during this crisis the billionaires in this country made according to wall street billion more dollars billion more dollars because that s his only measure what happens to the ordinary people out there what happens to them by the way as you know the republican leader in the united states senate said he can t pass it he will be able to pass it he does not have republican votes why isn t he talking to his republican friends i have and they have pushed it look they passed this act all the way back in the beginning of the summer it s not new it s been out there this heroes act has been sitting there and look at what s happening when i was in charge of the recovery act with billion i was able to get billion to local communities that have to balance their budgets and states that have to balance their budgets and then they have to fire firefighters teachers first responders law enforcement officers so they could keep their cities and counties running he will not support that they have not done a thing for them and mitch mcconnell said let them go bankrupt let them go bankrupt come on what s the matter with these guys by the way if i get elected i m not going to i m running as a proud democrat but i m going to be an american president i don t see red states and blue states what i see is american united states and folks every single state out there finds themself in trouble they re going to start laying off whether they re red or blue cops firefighters first responders teachers because they have to balance their budget and the founders were smart they allowed the federal government to deficit spend to compensate for the united states of america i do because i think one of the things we re going to have to do is we re going to have to bail them out too we should be bailing them out now those small businesses you got one in six of them going under they re not going to be able to make it back they passed a package that allows us to be able they call it ppp money is supposed to go to help them do everything from organize how they can deal with their businesses being open safely schools how they can make classrooms smaller how they can hire more teachers how they can put ventilation systems in they need the help the businesses as well as the schools need the help these guys will not help them it s not giving them any of the money not true by the way every no one should work one job be below poverty people are making six seven eight bucks an hour these first responders we all clap for as they come down the street because they ve allowed us to make it what s happening they deserve a minimum wage of anything below that puts you below the poverty level and there is no evidence that when you raise the minimum wage businesses go out of business that is simply not true it s an crosstalk these plus kids came with parents they separated them at the border to make it a disincentive to come to begin with be real tough we re really strong and guess what they cannot coyotes didn t bring them over their parents were with them they got separated from their parents and it makes us a laughingstock and violates every notion of who we are as a nation we did not separate the crosstalk let s talk about what we re talking about let s talk about what we re talking about what happened parents were ripped their kids were ripped from their arms and separated and now they cannot find over of the sets of those parents and those kids are alone nowhere to go nowhere to go it s criminal it s criminal because we made a mistake made it took too long to get it right took too long to get it right i ll be president of the united states not vice president of the united states and the fact is i ve made it very clear within a days i m going to send to the united states congress a pathway to citizenship for over million undocumented people and all of those so called dreamers those daca kids they re going to be immediately certified again to be able to stay in this country and put on a path to citizenship the idea that they are being sent home by this guy and they want to do that is they ve gone to they ve never seen before i can imagine you re five years old your parents are taking across the rio grande river and it s illegal and you say oh no mom leave me here i m not going to go with you they been here many of them are model citizens over of them are first responders out there taking care of people during this crisis we owe them we owe them the catch and release you know what he s talking about there if in fact you had a family came across and they were arrested they in fact were given a date to show up for their hearing they were released and guess what they showed up for a hearing and this is the first president in the history of the united states of america that anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country that s never happened before in america that s never happened before in america you come to the united states and you make your case that i seek asylum based on the following premise why i deserve it under american law they re sitting in squalor on the other side of the river know the law what he s telling you is simply not true check it out check it out that s right and you kids not knowing where in god s name they re going to be and lost their parents i do i do my daughter is a social worker and she s written a lot about this she has her graduate degree from the university of pennsylvania in social work and one of the reasons why i ended up working on the east side of wilmington delaware which is african american was to learn more about what was going on i never had to tell my daughter if she s pulled over make sure she puts for a traffic stop put both hands on top of the wheel and don t reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you but a black parent no matter how wealthy or how poor they are has to teach their child when you re walking down the street don t have a hoodie on when you go across the street making sure that you in fact if you get pulled over just yes sir no sir hands on top of the wheel because you are in fact the victim whether you re a person making child of a a year person or someone who s on food stamps the fact of the matter is there is institutional racism in america and we have always said we ve never lived up to it that we hold these truths to be self evident all men and women are created equal well guess what we have never ever lived up to it but we ve always constantly been moving the needle further and further to inclusion not exclusion this is the first president to come along and says that s the end of that we re not going to do that anymore we have to provide for economic opportunity better education better healthcare better access to schooling better access to opportunity to borrow money to start businesses all the things we can do and i ve laid out a clear plan as to how to do those things just to give people a shot it s about accumulating the ability to have wealth as well as it is to be free from violence my response to that is i never ever said what he accused me of saying the fact of the matter is in though after the crime bill had been in the law for awhile this is a guy who said the problem with the crime bill there s not enough people in jail there s not enough people in jail and go on my website get the quote the date when he said it not enough people he talked about marauding gangs young gangs and the people who are going to maraud our cities this is a guy who in the central park five five innocent black kids he continued to push for making sure that they got the death penalty none of them were guilty of the crimes they were suggested look and granted he did in fact let people he commuted people s sentences we commuted over people s sentences over the very law he s talking about is a law that in fact initiated by barack obama and secondly we re in a situation here where the federal prison system was reduced by people under our administration and one of those things we should be doing there should be no no minimum mandatories in the law that s why i m offering billion to states to change their state laws to eliminate minimum mandatories and set up drug courts no one should be going to jail because they have a drug problem they should be going to rehabilitation not to jail we should fundamentally change the system and that s what i m going to do we did well i ll tell you what i hope he does look at me because what s happening here is you know who i am you know who he is you know his character you know my character you know our reputations for honor and telling the truth i am anxious to have this race i m anxious to see this take place i am the character of the country is on the ballot our character s on the ballot look at us closely nobody s calling me nobody i have to respond to that because look there are former national intelligence folks who said that what he s accusing me of is a russian plant they have said that this has all the five former heads of the cia both parties say what he s saying is a bunch of garbage nobody believes it except him and his good friend rudy giuliani that s exactly what was told abraham lincoln here is one of the most racist presidents we ve had in modern history he pours fuel on every single racist fire every single one started off his campaign coming down the escalator saying he s getting rid of those mexican rapists he s ban muslims because they re muslims he has moved around and made everything worse across the board he says to about the proud boys last time we were on stage here he said i tell them to stand down and stand ready come on this guy has a dog whistle about as big as a foghorn you said you re abraham lincoln you said and i m saying oh god not true one of the things is that in the s we passed percent all senators voted for a bill on drugs and how to deal with drugs it was a mistake i ve been trying to change since then particularly the portion on cocaine that s why i ve been arguing that in fact we should not send anyone to jail for a pure drug offense they should be going into treatment across the board that s what we should be spending money and that s why i set up drug courts which were never funded by our republican friends they should not be going to jail for a drug or an alcohol problem they should be going into treatment that s what we ve been trying to do that s what i m going to get done because i think the american people have now seen that in fact it was a mistake to pass those laws relating to drugs but they were not in the crime bill we got a lot of it done we released we got prisoners crosstalk prisoners were released from federal prison we have there were over a thousand people who were given clemency inaudible in fact were the ones that put in the legislation saying we could look at pattern and practice of police departments and what they were doing how they re conducting themselves i could go on but we began the process we lost an election that s why i m running to win back that election and change his terrible policy crosstalk we had a republican congress that s the answer you did what we already had done climate change global warming is an existential threat to humanity we have a moral obligation to deal with it and we re told by all the leading scientists in the world we don t have much time we re going to pass the point of no return within the next to years four more years of this man eliminating all the regulations that were put in by us to clean up the climate to clean up to limit the emissions will put us in a position where we re going to be in real trouble here s where we have a great opportunity i was able to get both all the environmental organizations as well as the labor the people worried about jobs to support my climate plan because what it does it will create millions of new good paying jobs we re going to invest in for example excuse me charging stations on our highways so that we can own the electric car market of the future in the meantime china is doing that we re going to be in a position where we re going to see to it that we re going to take million existing buildings and million existing homes and retrofit them so they don t leak as much energy saving hundreds of millions of barrels of so they don t leak as much energy saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the process and creating significant number of jobs by the way the whole idea of what this is all going to do it s going to create millions of jobs and it s going to clean the environment our health and our jobs are at stake that s what s happening and what right now by the way wall street firms indicated that my plan my plan will in fact create million jobs million more than his this is from wall street and i ll create trillion more in economic growth than his proposal does not on climate just on economy crosstalk i don t know where he comes from i don t know where he comes up with these numbers a hundred trillion dollars give me a break this plan has been endorsed by every major every major environmental group and every labor group labor because they know the future lies the future lies in us being able to breathe and they know they re good jobs and getting us there by the way the fastest growing industry in america is the electric excuse me solar energy and wind he thinks wind causes cancer windmills it s the fastest growing jobs and they pay good prevailing wages bucks an hour we can grow and we can be cleaner if we go the route i m proposing find me a scientist who says that false i never said i oppose fracking show the tape put it on your website put it on the website the fact of the matter is he s flat lying i do rule out banning fracking because the answer we need we need other industries to transition to get to ultimately a complete zero emissions by what i will do with fracking over time is make sure that we can capture the emissions from the fracking capture the emissions from gas we can do that and we can do that by investing money in doing it but it s a transition to that good fracking on federal land i said no fracking and or oil on federal land my response is that those people live on what they call fence lines he doesn t understand this they live near chemical plants that in fact pollute chemical plants and oil plants and refineries that pollute i used to live near that when i was growing up in claymont delaware and there are more oil refineries in marcus hook and the delaware river than there is any place including in houston at the time when my mom get in the car and when there are first frost to drive me to school turning the windshield wiper there d been oil slick in the window that s why so many people in my state were dying and getting cancer the fact is those frontline communities it s not a matter of what you re paying them it matters how you keep them safe what do you do you impose restrictions on the pollutions that if the pollutants coming out of those fence line communities by the way i have a transition from the old industry yes i will transition it is a big statement because i would stop because the oil industry pollutes significantly here s the deal well if you let me finish the statement because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time over time and i d stopped giving to the oil industry i d stop giving them federal subsidies you won t get federal subsidies to the gas oh excuse me to solar and wind why are we giving it to oil industry he takes everything out of context but the point is look we have to move toward net zero emissions the first place to do that by the year is in energy production by totally no i m going to rejoin paris accord and make china abide by what they agreed to i will say i m an american president i represent all of you whether you voted for me or against me and i m going to make sure that you re represented i m going to give you hope we re going to move we re going to choose science over fiction we re going to choose hope over fear we re going to choose to move forward because we have enormous opportunities enormous opportunities to make things better we can grow this economy we can deal with the systemic racism at the same time we can make sure that our economy is being run and moved and motivated by clean energy creating millions of new jobs that s the fact that s what we re going to do and i m going to say as i said at the beginning what is on the ballot here is the character of this country decency honor respect treating people with dignity making sure that everyone has an even chance and i m going to make sure you get that you haven t been getting it the last four years thank you
